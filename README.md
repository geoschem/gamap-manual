# GAMAP Manual Pages

GAMAP (Global Atmospheric Modeling and Analysis Package) is no longer
being actively maintained.  We recommend GAMAP users to migrate to
[GCPy, our GEOS-Chem Python Tookit](https://gcpy.readthedocs.io).

However, GAMAP is still being used in a few contexts, such as:

  - Analyzing data output from the Adjoint of GEOS-Chem Classic
  
  - Plotting "model vs. observations" from GEOS-Chem Classic 1-year
  benchmark simulations
  
For this reason, we have preserved the GAMAP manual pages [at this
wiki](https://github.com/geoschem/gamap-manual/wiki).
