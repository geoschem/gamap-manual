 NAME:
        GAMAP

 PURPOSE:
        Menu-driven user interface for creating plots with
        the GAMAP package subroutines. The actual data retrieval
        and plotting is done with ctm_plot.pro. This routine
        mainly collects all user requests and passes them on to
        CTM_PLOT.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GAMAP, [ DiagN [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: use all).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        General keywords:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        FILENAME -> CTM output file name. Default is to display a
             pickfile dialog and let the user select. You can have
             wildcards ('*', '?') in your filename which restricts
             the file selection.

        /NOFILE -> Don't query for filename but display all records that
             have already been loaded. This can save you a couple of
             mouse clicks when you want to create several plots with
             data from one file, and it also useful when you want
             to plot data from 'external' files that were converted
             with ctm_make_datainfo. If a filename is given or no
             data were loaded, the file selection dialog will appear
             anyhow.

        /RESETDEFAULTS -> If set, will reset all GAMAP values to their
             defaults.

        /HELP -> Displays a help page.

        RESULT -> Returns a structure with the data subset as plotted and
             the respective X and Y coordinates. Returns only one data
             record though.

        TOPTITLE -> Add a specific title centered on top of each page
             of output.

        Keywords to restrict the number of records displayed for selection:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        TRACER -> A tracer number to restrict record selection

        TAU0 -> Time value (at beginning of record)

        DATE -> 6 digit date (e.g. 940101) at the beginning of the
             output record (this gets translated into a TAU0
             value via the function nymd2tau). You can specify more
             than one date at a time using a vector (e.g. [940101, 940301]).
             For the GISS model(s), you also have to specify /GISS_Date in
             order to get correct tau values. The time is assumed to
             be 00 GMT. For other times use the TAU0 keyword as
             TAU0=nymd2tau(dates,times).

        /GISS_Date -> set this flag if you are using the DATE keyword
             with GISS model output.

        Keywords defining output options (these override defaults in
        gamap.defaults)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        /PS -> If set, will directly send output to the 'idl.ps' file.
             If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether to create
             the 'idl.ps' file.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of file to send PostScript output to.

        /NOTIMESTAMP -> Do not include a user ID and time stamp
             on the postscript plot. Unnecessary if the TIMESTAMP value
             in gamap.defaults is set to 0.

        XSIZE, YSIZE, XOFFSET, YOFFSET -> GAMAP will pass these
             keywords to routine OPEN_DEVICE, for setting the size
             and margins of PostScript output.  

        /DO_BMP -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to BMP files.  DO_BMP overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        BMPFILENAME -> Name of BMP file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in BMPFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             BMPFILENAME is not set, or if DO_BMP is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             BMPFILENAME.

        /DO_GIF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as GIF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to GIF files.  DO_GIF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        GIFFILENAME -> Name of GIF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in GIFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             GIFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_GIF is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             GIFFILENAME.

        /DO_JPEG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to JPEG files.  DO_JPEG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        JPEGFILENAME -> Name of JPEG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in JPEGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             JPEGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_JPEG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             JPEGFILENAME.

        /DO_PNG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as PNG
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to PNG files.  DO_PNG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        PNGFILENAME -> Name of PNG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in PNGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             PNGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             PNGFILENAME.

        /DO_TIFF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as TIFF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to TIFF files.  DO_TIFF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        TIFFFILENAME -> Name of TIFF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in TIFFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             TIFFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             TIFFFILENAME.

        /POLAR -> Set this keyword for polar pots. This forces latitude
             ranges to extend to one pole and longitude ranges to span
             the globe. Polar plots only work for global (at least 
             longitudinally) data sets.  Currently, polar plots are 
             supported only for contour plots.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_PLOT, etc...

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) GAMAP can read ASCII punch files with GEOS or GISS, model II
            diagnostics, binary punch files (as defined in Jan 1999),
            and GEOS-CTM binary restart files. Binary punch files
            are processed much faster and allow "windowing" of output.

        (2) For pixel plots, GAMAP can only plot cylindrical maps
            with rectangular projections.  Arbitrary map projections
            should be possible with any type of contour plot. For 
            polar plots, use the /POLAR keyword. Other projections 
            have not been tested and may lead to unexpected results.

        (3) GAMAP forces map ranges to coincide with the grid box
            edges, so that the map and pixel plot will be aligned.
            Each "pixel" size corresponds to one full grid box.
            For grids with half-polar boxes, it is therefore recommended
            not to plot the polar latitudes, since those boxes will
            show up as full-size boxes and shift the rest of the plot
            accordingly.

        (4) When the user selects multiple data blocks, GAMAP will produce
            a multi-panel plot if !p.multi indicates more than one panel
            on the screen (use the MULTIPANEL procedure to turn it on).
            If you plot only one panel per screen, GAMAP will automatically
            start XInterAnimate to present your own movie to you. Be
            aware that XInterAnimate is limited by your system resources.
            With default window sizes, we can usually display at least
            30 frames.  ADDENDUM: 3-D isopleth maps will not be
            animated. (bmy, 1/22/01)

        (5) Animation frames can also be written to GIF or MPEG
            files.  Defaults can be set in "gamap.defaults", or
            specified via the command line. You can also save individual
            GAMAP plots as GIF files. If you want to animate them later
            (e.g. using ULead's GIF-Animator), make sure to specify the
            RANGE keyword to get identical color schemes (or use contours).

        (6) The GAMAP authors wish to point out that it is still relatively
            expensive to produce color plots on the printer. We encourage
            you to try out contour plots and make a test print on a black
            and white printer before you make a color print.

        (7) The 3-D isopleth maps do not quite work with MULTIPANEL, since
            they are produced with screen capture in the Z-Buffer.  Hence  
            Hence, the X window device has to be re-initialized each time, 
            which negates the MULTIPANEL utility.  PostScript plots of 3-D
            isopleth maps will print one plot per page.  We can live with
            this for the time being.  Isopleth maps can also be written
            to GIF files.

        (8) Now uses D. Fanning's TVREAD function to perform better
            device-independent screen capture. (cf. www.dfanning.com)

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        GAMAP
            ; operates fully interactively

        MULTIPANEL,nplots=6       ; turn on multi-panel environment
        GAMAP
            ; same as above, but produce multi-panel plots with
            ; 6 plots per page

        (2)
        GAMAP, 'IJ-AVG-$', tra=4
            ; Will create a CO (tracer=4) plot for the ND45 diagnostic.
            ; GAMAP will display dialog pickfile box and will scan the
            ; file for all records with ND45 and tracer 4. Those will be
            ; displayed and the user can then select a record to be plotted.

        (3)
        GAMAP, [ 'IJ-AVG-$', 'BIOBSRCE' ], tra=[2,4], $
               date=[19940601, 19940801], $
            FileName='~bmy/terra/CTM4/ctm.pch',/ps
            ; In this example the file is fully specified, hence no file
            ; selection dialog will be displayed. GAMAP scans the file
            ; for all records of 'IJ-AVG-$' and 'BIOBSRCE' and tracers
            ; 2 (OX) and 4 (NOX) and it seelcts only those records that
            ; begin on the first of JUNE or AUGUST 1994. Because the ps
            ; flag is set, the output will be directed to the postscript
            ; file 'idl.ps' without first being displayed on the screen.


 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

                          - now uses N_UNIQ.PRO to test for the number
                            of unique elements in LON, LAT, and LEVEL.
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998: - finishing touches for first release.

        bmy, 17 Feb 1999: VERSION 1.20
                          - Replace DATAINFO.OFFSET by DATAINFO.FIRST,
                            which contains the I, J, L indices of
                            the first grid box
                          - Animation facility added

                            boxes, since TVIMAGE will treat them as
                            whole boxes and the map overlay will be
                            inaccurate!

                          - now allows for 2D field plots
        bmy, 17 May 1999: - now resolve DEFAULT_RANGE explicitly and
                            call DEFRANGE_STR2NUM separately
                          - few minor fixes in GAMAP_UserRangeEntry for

                          - user selection for longitudes greatly improved
                          - some adjustments in FindNearestEdges, notably
                            for range 0..360. Unfortunately, the 0 meridian
                            gridline will be omitted in such plots. If we
                            wanted to include it we would need to carry
                            an extra GLOBAL flag because lower and upper
                            edges (grid box indices) are identical.
        mgs, 20 May 1999: - added option to save record seelction to file.
        mgs, 24 May 1999: - yet more work had to be done to make lon/lat
                            selection as user would expect it to work.
                          - renamed FindNearestEdges to ..Centers
        mgs, 25 May 1999: - still more fiddling. Yuck!

 NAME:
        GAMAP2_HTML

 PURPOSE:
        Wrapper routine for IDL2HTML.  Is used to call IDL2HTML 
        repeatedly in order to create HTML documentation for each
        of the source code files in the GAMAP installation.  The
        user may sort routines by alphabetical order or by category.

 CATEGORY:
        Documentation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GAMAP2_HTML [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTDIR -> Specifies the directory in which HTML documenation
             will be created.  Passes this to IDL2HTML.

        /ALL_ROUTINES -> Select this option to create an HTML file
             with documentation information about all routines
             in the GAMAP directory.  The output file name will be
             "gamap2_html.pro".

        /BY_ALPHABET -> Select this option to create HTML documentation
             files for GAMAP routines by alphabetical order.  A file
             will be created for each letter of the alphabet.

        /BY_CATEGORY -> Select this option to create HTML documentation
             files for GAMAP routines according to category (as
             specified by the "CATEGORY" tag of the IDL doc header).
             A files will be created for each individual category.

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from the Geos-CHEM ND48
        diagnostics contained in one or more binary punch files.

        The goal is to combine, for one station, all the data blocks
        (there is one per time step) into one single 4-D data block
        (we want the time to be the 4th dimension). This is basically
        to take advantage of support for 4D dataset in GAMAP v2-10.

        GEOS-Chem ND48 (as in v7-04-12) outputs one file for all
        stations and all time steps. GC_COMBINE_ND48 will write one
        file but each timeseries will be in one data block instead of
        as many as the number of timesteps. This will make reading
        the timeseries with CTM_GET_DATA a lot faster.

        Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        applied: moving average and/or daily maximum.

        LIMITATION: daily maximum will not make sense if series do
        not cover full days.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Time Series

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48 [, Keywords ]

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

        By defaults all stations are processed. And one output file
        is created that contains all the stations timeseries.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        INFILE -> one or more station file(s) from ND48
              diagnostic. If more than one file is processed, it is
              assumed that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they
              are in chronological order (this is automatically the
              case, if you insert YYYYMMDD into ND48 filenames in
              input.geos).

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for "stations" files. Can be
             either input or output keyword:

             Input: when defined, ALL files satisfying the MASK
                    keyword in the directory will be selected.

             Ouput: set to a variable name that will contains the DIR
                    of the selected files.

             It is ignored (both input and output roles) if INFILE is
             provided.

             If neither INFILE nor INDIR is set, then a dialog window
             that allows multiple files selection (keep CTRL or SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up.


        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "stations*".

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             new timeseries. Default is 'combined'+INFILE[0], in the
             same directory as stations file. If the full path is not
             included, the file is created in the working directory.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;================= Data Selection ======================

        STATIONNB -> Station(s) number. Can be one or more elements
              (up to the number of stations in ND48). Use to select a
              subset of the stations instead of all of them.

        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data is selected.

              If min and/or max of TIME is outside the range of
              available time steps, the first or last available time
              step is used.

              Note 1: this is also an output keyword. Then, if passed
              by reference, TIME becomes the time vector in
              output. See example (6).

              Note 2: if using DMAX or DAVG, then TIME should be long 
              integer (YYYYMMDD), if not it should be Tau format.

        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NAN,
              EDGE_TRUNCATE, and MISSING).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average. (Local time is not accounted for: days start
              and end at 0 UT everywhere).

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average. (Local time is not accounted for: days
              start and end at 0 UT everywhere).


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        All the following keywords will apply to only ONE
        station. The last one is used if none or more than one is
        requested.

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (1,1,lev,time) even though only one station is
             selected.

        LON -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             longitude of the data set on exit.

        LAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             latitude of the data set on exit.

        LEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of levels for the data set on exit.

        TIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector for the station on exit. Given as Tau values,
             unless DMAX or DAVG is set, then as YYYYMMDD.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, the TIME vector is in local time
             instead of UT. Has no effect if /DMAX or /DAVG.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. particularly useful to double check
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.


 OUTPUTS:
        See output keywords above.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References many routines from GAMAP package. Requires GAMAP
        v2.10 for handling 4D dataset.

 NOTES:
       If memory issues show up, try to save one timeseries (i.e.,
       one station at a time).

 EXAMPLES:

        ;; (1) Read multiple timeseries files selected w/ a pop-up
        window (use SHIFT key for muliple selections). Save with the
        default filename in the default directory:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48


        ;; (2) Like example (1), but saves only the daily max of the
        ;;     9-hours average timeseries:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, /dmax, mavg=8



        ;; (3) read ALL stations files from directory '~/path/'
        ;; without a pop-up window (no interactivity, good for batch
        ;; processing). Default MASk and outfile name are used.

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, indir='~/path/'


        ;; (4) Like example (3) but select only the first available
        ;; station, and save the result in a specified file:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, Station=1, indir='~/path/', outfile='~/path/series1.bpch'


        ;; (5) read files from directory '~/path/', and select 3rd station.
        ;; Do not save combined timeseries. Get outputs in variables
        ;; data, lon, lat and time.

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, indir='~/path/', station=3, data=data, lon=lon, lat=lat, time=time

        Help, reform(data)
        PLOT, time, data[0,0,0,*], title='Lon= strtrim(lon,2)+'- Lat='+strtrim(lat,2)


        ;; (6) Like (5), but limit the time to 23rd-28th of July
        ;;     2001. Not the use of two commands to get the output
        ;;     time vector.

        time = [nymd2tau(20010723L,20010728l)]

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND49

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from several bpch files into 4D
        data. Typically used with Geos-CHEM ND49 timeseries output
        and met fields in bpch files (a3, a6, i6). 
        
        For met fields, see example (9) and (10).

        Each ND49 and Met Fields file has data for one day. But,
        files with time series that do no cover a day per file, can
        also be processed. See example (11), but keep in mind that
        the daily max or average options are then **** MEANINGLESS
        ****, and should not be used.


        WHAT IS DONE:
        
        (1) We combine all the data blocks for one tracer (there is
        one per time step) into one single 4-D data block (with time
        in 4th dimension). This takes advantage of support for 4D
        dataset introduced in GAMAP v2-10.

        (2) The combined series can be saved into a binary punch
        file. You end up with one file per tracer that covers many
        days of output, instead of one file per day for all
        tracers. The space saving can be more than 60%.

        (3) A subarea (even a single location) can be extracted. But
        for multiple but not contiguous locations, call the routine
        as many time as needed.

        (4) Shorter timeseries can be selected/saved, by specifying
        Tau range, or day (as YYYYMMDD long integer) range if daily
        max or average is selected.

        (5) Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        performed: moving average and/or daily
        maximum/minimum/average.

        ## LIMITATION ## : full days considered for ND49, ie,
        GEOS-Chem runs should start and end at midnight (YYYYMMDD
        000000 in input.geos)

             for which to read data.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        FILELIST -> list of files to process. Usually used as output
             keyword to get the list of files selected with INDIR and
             MASK or through a dialog window.
             Can be used as input. Then INDIR and MASK are ignored.

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for MASK files.  If
             provided, ALL files satisfying the MASK keyword in the
             directory will be selected. If not provided, a dialog
             window that allows multiple files selection (keep SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up. See EXAMPLES below for tips.

             If set to an undefined variable name, it will hold the
             directory of the selected files (output keyword).

             NOTE: If more than one file is processed, it is assumed
             that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they are in
             chronological order (this is the case with GEOS-Chem
             default naming of ND49 output files: they contain
             YYYYMMDD).

        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "ts*.bpch".

        OUTDIR -> Output directory where to save the file with the
             new timeseries data set will be. Default is INDIR. If
             the user has not write permission in INDIR, writintg is
             cancelled.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             timeseries. Default is 'combts_%TRACERNAME%.bpch', for
             COMB ined  T ime  S eries.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;============ To extract subset of data ===================

        LON -> A one or two-elements vector specifying the longitude
            of one location or one area. If LON is outside the ND49
            area, the program print a warning, and uses border
            value.

        LAT -> same as LON, but for Latitudes

        LEV -> same as LON, but for Levels. Refers to the model grid.


        ; - - you can also select indices into the requested 3D cube:

        LLEV -> A one or two-element vector specifying the min and
             max of available levels to be included in the file.
             Default is ALL available levels.
             Default FORTRAN indexing is used: LLEV #1 is the first
             level ***requested*** in ND49. See LEV above otherwise.

        ILON, JLAT -> same as LLEV but for Longitude and Latitude
             indices. Starting at 1 at the first ***requested***
             grid box in ND49.


        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data are selected.
              TIME must be given as Tau (double) or YYYYMMDD (long)
              if /DMAX or /DAVG.
              If both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME are set, TIME is
              ignored. 

          ** TIP ** if you select a short time span, it may be
                    useful to limit the number of files to process
                    by redefining MASK or using FILELIST. That will
                    speed up the process.


        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NaN,
              Edge_truncate, missing).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average.

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average.

        LOCALTIME -> to get DAVG or DMAX computed over local days
              instead of UT days. See details below.


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (nLon, nLat, nLevel, ntime) even if only one location is
             selected.

        OUTLON -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of longitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of latitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of Levels of the data set on exit.

        OUTALT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of altitudes for the data set on exit.

        OUTTIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector corresponding to the data set on exit. Format
             is Tau, or YYYYMMDD if /DMAX.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, OUTTIME becomes a Nb_OutLon X Nb_TimeStep
             array, with each vector OUTTIME[i,*] holding the time
             vector in local time instead of UT. That vector will
             apply to all j and k for DATA[i,j,k,*].


           Specific case of...  both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME
             being set. The daily max (average) is obtained after
             shifting the timeseries, so they start at 00 LT
             everywhere (or the first available time step just before
             00 LT). The first max (average) value is for the first
             complete local day of the series. The OUTTIME array is
             then a [numbers of complete days, 2] array that gives
             the local YYYYMMDD for both positive and negative
             longitudes.

             See also note about TAU0/TAU1 below.

             Note that the time step of the series must be small
             enough for the DMAX/DAVG w/r/t Local Time to be
             reliable.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. Particularly useful to double check the
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.


 OUTPUTS:
        See output keywords above.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References many routines from GAMAP package. Requires GAMAP
        v2.10 for saving 4D dataset into binary punch file.

 NOTES:
        ######## ND49 and Met Fields only. For ND48, see  ########
        ######## GC_COMBINE_ND48 (not as well maintained) ########

        Written with batch processing in mind. It is recommended to
        save all ND49 outputs into one dedicated directory, and to
        use keywords (INDIR, OUTDIR, OUTFILE..) and save the new
        combined timeseries in a new directory.

        About TAU0 and TAU1 : in the DataInfo structure, they are set
        to the beginning and end of the timeseries. For daily data,
        we compute them by setting HH:MM:SS to 00:00:00. If LocalTime
        is set, UT is still used for TAU0 and TAU1, so we can use
        only one value. If both LocalTime and DMAX are set, tau0 and
        tau1 give the first and last (local) days for longitudes less
        than 0 (west). For East longitudes, you need to add one day
        to these to get the correct date.
 

 EXAMPLES:
        ;; In the following examples, it is assumed that tracer 1
        ;; has been saved with ND49


        ;; (1) Read multiple timeseries files selected w/ a pop-up

 NAME:
        GETDATABLOCK

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve information stored in a DATA block somewhere
        within an IDL routine. The DATA block must be "hidden"
        as comment lines for the IDL compiler. The data will be 
        returned as string array.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GETDATABLOCK, DATA [, FILENAME=FILENAME, ,LABEL=LABEL ]

 INPUTS:

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> optional filename. Normally, the data block is
            read from the file that contains the current procedure

        LABEL -> a unique identifier for the start of the data block.
            Default is '/DATA/'. The end of the data block is reached
            at the end of file or if the block of comment lines ends.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> a string array with the information contained in the 
            data block

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ======================================
        FILE_EXIST (function)   ROUTINE_NAME

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The file with the datablock is always searched in !PATH

 EXAMPLE:
        GETDATABLOCK, SDATA

             ; This will retrieve a data block labeled '/DATA/' 
             ; from the file of the current IDL routine

        (13) MATCH         52-layer (name: "MATCH"        )

        Computing pressure and eta coordinates:
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        In a vertical column, the pressure at the bottom edge of 
        grid box (L) is given by:

           Pe(L)   = A(L) + ( B(L) * Psurface )

        and the pressure at the vertical midpoint of grid box (L)
        is just a simple average of the pressures at the box edges:

           Pc(L)   = ( Pe(L) + Pe(L+1) ) * 0.5

        From PEDGE and PCENTER, we can construct the unitless coordinate 
        ETA (which is very similar to the sigma coordinate) as follows:

           ETAe(L) = ( Pe(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop ) 

           ETAc(L) = ( Pc(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )
 
        For GAMAP plotting routines, we will use the ETA coordinate 
        for hybrid models instead of the sigma coordinate.

        Psurface is a function of longitude and latitude.  GAMAP uses 
        a default Psurface of 1013 hPa (1 atm).  However, you should 
        always compute the pressure edges and centers from an accurate 
        surface pressure field (i.e. from met field data files or from 
        GEOS-Chem or other model output.
   
 EXAMPLE:
        EETA = GETETA( 'GEOS4' PSURF=984.0, /EDGES );
             ; assigns GEOS-1 eta edges to array EETA

        CETA = GETETA( 'GEOS4', /CENTERS, PRESSURE=CPRESS )
             ; assigns GISS-II eta centers to array CETA
             ; (Optional) also returns the pressure at level centers

        concise strings for a given value range. The format
        should be applied in a string() statement and the 
        string should be trimmed.

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MYFORMAT = GET_DEFAULTFORMAT(minval,maxval [,/LOG])

 INPUTS:
        MINVAL, MAXVAL -> the range of values that shall be 
            displayed with this format.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /LOG -> set this keyword if you plan logarithmic labels.
            (changes behaviour for 0.001)

        DEFAULTLEN -> 1 or 2 strings with the default length 
            specification for 'f' and 'e' formats. If only one
            string is passed, it will be used for both, otherwise
            the first string applies to 'f' and the second to 'e'.
            Example: DEFAULTLEN='10.3' results in 'f10.3'.

        THRESHOLD -> threshold value to switch from 'f' to 'e' format.
            Default is '2' for linear and '3' for log scale. This
            value is determined by the negative decadal log of (maxv-minv)
            plus 2.

 OUTPUTS:
        MYFORMAT -> A format string (e.g. '(f14.2)' )

 SUBROUTINES:
        none

 REQUIREMENTS:
        none

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        PRINT, GET_DEFAULTFORMAT( 0.01, 1. )
          '(f14.2)'

        PRINT, GET_DEFAULTFORMAT( 0.0001, 0.01 )
          '(e12.3)'

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        GET_DIFF_RANGE

 PURPOSE:
        Returns a default plotting range for given GEOS-Chem tracers 
        This will be used to create absolute difference plots for 
        GEOS-Chem benchmarking.

 CATEGORY:
        Benchmarking

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RANGE = GET_DIFF_RANGE( TRACERNAME )

 INPUTS:
        TRACERNAME -> Name of the tracer for which a default
             plotting range will be returned.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RANGE -> A 2 element vector with the [min,max] values
             to be used in creating a tracer difference plot.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Routine READ_DIFF_RANGE must be called before this routine
        may be used.  This will normally be done at the top of
        driver routine BENCHMARK_1MON.

 NOTES:
        (1) Meant to be used in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem 
            benchmark plotting codes.
 
        (2) Default ranges for each tracer are read from a file by the 
            complementary routine READ_DIFF_RANGE and stored in the
            GDR common block.

 EXAMPLE:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE, 'diff_range.1mon'
        PRINT, GET_DIFF_RANGE( 'NOx' )
            -0.100000  0.100000

 NAME:
        GET_FREELUN (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Return next available logical unit number. Unlike 
        the internal GET_LUN procedure, this function is not
        restricted to unit numbers above 100, and it will 
        detect any blocked unit number.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        lun = GET_FREELUN([LUN])

 INPUTS:
        none

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        none

 OUTPUTS:
        The lowest available logical unit number. This number is 
        also returned in the LUN parameter for later use.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:

 NAME:
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS

 PURPOSE:
        Returns zonal mean pressure edges and pressure centers
        for the GEOS-5 grid (47 layers or 72 layers).  Because in
        GEOS-5 we cannot compute the pressures at grid box edges
        and centers, we must read them in from disk.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Models & Grids

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS, PEDGE, PMID [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Specifies the name of the file containing
             average pressures on the GEOS-5 grid.  If FILENAME
             is omitted, then GET_GEOS5_PRESS will use the default
             filename: "pedge.geos5.{RESOLUTION}.year".  

        NLAYERS -> Specifies the number of layers in the GEOS-5 
             grid.  NLAYERS can be either 47 or 72.  Default is 47.

        RESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the GEOS-5 grid. 
             Default is 4x5.

        PSURF -> If specified, then PEDGE and PMID will be 1-D
             vectors, with the surface pressure (i.e. PEDGE[0])
             being closest to the passed value of PSURF. 

        /VERBOSE -> Set this switch to toggle verbose output.

 OUTPUTS:
        PEDGE -> Array (or vector if PSURF is specified) of pressures 
             at GEOS-5 grid box edges.  The PEDGE values have been 
             averaged over 12 months and also averaged over longitudes 
             (i.e. zonal mean).
 
        PMID -> Array (or vector if PSURF is specified) of pressures 
             at GEOS-5 grid box centers.  The pressures have been 
             averaged over 12 months and also averaged over longitudes 
             (i.e. zonal mean).

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===================================

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) At present, we only have saved out a file containing
            pressure edges from the GEOS-5 47-layer model.

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS, PEDGE, PMID, RES=2

             ; Returns pressues at grid box edges (PEDGE) and centers
             ; (PMID) for the GEOS-5 47L model at 2 x 2.5 resolution.
             ; PEDGE is a 2-D array of size 91x48.  PMID is also a
             ; 2-D array of size 91x47.

        (2)
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS, PEDGE, PMID, RES=2, PSURF=1000.0

             ; Returns pressues at grid box edges (PEDGE) and centers
             ; (PMID) for the GEOS-5 47L model at 2 x 2.5 resolution.

 NOTES:
        (1) This is currently a KLUDGE.  Figure out a more 
            robust way of determining if fields are defined on 
            level edges or level centers later on. (bmy, 7/16/07)

        (2) Add more names to the CASE statement as necessary.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        PRINT, GET_IS_EDGED( 'PEDGE' )
          1
             ; The GEOS-5 PEDGE field is defined on the vertical
             ; grid edges, so GET_IS_EDGED returns 1.

        (2)
        PRINT, GET_IS_EDGED( 'UWND' )
          0

             ; The GEOS-5 UWND field is defined on the vertical

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME (optional) -> Name of the input GIF file.  
             If FILENAME is omitted then GIF2PS will prompt
             the user to supply a file name via a dialog box.
             FILENAME may contain wild card characters.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the output PostScript file.
             Default is "idl.ps".

        /FLIP_BW -> Set this keyword to turn black pixels into
             white pixels and vice-versa.  This is useful for
             creating PostScript files of GIF images that have a 
             dark background color.

 NOTES:
        (1) Image processing options are limited to flipping the
            black and white pixels.  This should be good enough
            for most purposes.

        (2) XMARGIN and YMARGIN assume that we are printing out for
            standard USA 8.5 x 11" page.  Device sizes listed below
            are also in inches.
