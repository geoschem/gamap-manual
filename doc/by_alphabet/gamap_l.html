 NAME:
        LEGEND

 PURPOSE:
        Annotate a plot with a legend.  Make it as simple as possible
        for the user.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        LEGEND, [several keywords]

 INPUTS:

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        HALIGN, VALIGN -> horizontal and vertical alignment of legend 
             with respect to plot window. Ranges from 0 to 1, and is 
             interpreted "dynamically": e.g. a value of 0.3 places 
             30% of the box left (below) 0.3*plotwindow size.
             Defaults are 0.98 and 0.03, i.e. the lower right corner.

        WIDTH -> width of the legend box. This parameter is defaulted
             to 40% of the plot area or may be adjusted to hold the
             longest LABEL string if CHARSIZE is given. If WIDTH is
             specified, it is used to determine the CHARSIZE. However,
             if both are given, they are both used and may lead to
             ugly results.

        POSITION -> a four element vector that gives complete control
             over the position of the legend box. Normally, you don't 
             need this keyword, but it may be handy in a multi-plot 
             situation where you want to place a legend independently
             of any individual plotting area. It can also be convenient 
             if you want to place legends interactively: simply call
             a rubberband program that returns the region coordinates 
             in normalized units, and pass this vector to the LEGEND 
             program.

        PLOTPOSITION -> 4 element vector that specifies the plotting 
             area.  Default is taken from !P.POSITION if set, otherwise 
             [0.2,0.1,0.9,0.9] is used as default. As noted above, 
             sizing and positioning of the legend box is with respect 
             to the plot position unless POSITION is specified.

        SYMBOL -> a vector (or one integer) containing symbol numbers 
             to plot. -1 can be used to skip one entry.  These values 
             are arguments to the SYM() function. If you like to
             label plain IDL symbols, use the PSYM keyword instead.
 
        PSYM -> same as symbol, but passes its values directly to PSYM
             in the plots command, i.e. produces generic IDL symbols.

        SYMSIZE -> symbol size. Normally, this value is adjusted auto-
             matically to match the character size. 
        
        COLOR -> a number or vector of color values for the symbols. 
             One entry is used per symbol. If only one entry is 
             provided, all symbols are plotted in the same color. 
             Default is black.

        LINE -> a vector with linestyles. Symbols and lines can be 
             used together. Entries with -1 are skipped.

        LCOLOR -> color values for the lines

        THICK -> line thickness. Can be any number of element. The
                 program cycles through them if there is more lines
                 than elements in THICK. Defaut is 1 for all. 

        LABEL -> a string array containing the legend text lines. 
             One line should correspond to one symbol. If you have a 
             two line entry, you can either pass it as two lines or
             use the '!C' carriage return command. In both cases you 
             have to set the SYMBOL and LINE values that correspond
             to the second line to -1 in order to skip the symbol for 
             it. If you use '!C', your next LABEL should be blank.

        TEXTCOLOR -> A color value for the label and title output.
             Default is black.

        TITLE -> a title string for the legend. 

        CHARSIZE -> character size for all labelling. Default is to 
             determine the character size automatically so that the largest
             LABEL and TITLE fit into the legend box. On the other hand you
             can specify CHARSIZE and have the legend size itself. 

        SPACING -> spacing between legend lines. Default is 2, lower values
             produce narrower spacing and may be useful for extensive 
             legends. You can set the IDL default line spacing by setting
             SPACING to float(!D.Y_CH_SIZE)/!D.X_CH_SIZE.

        NLINES -> number of lines the legend box shall hold. Normally,
             this value is determined automatically from the maximum number
             of entries in SYMBOL, PSYM, LINE, and LABEL. It may however
             be useful to set NLINES manually if you want to ADD extra
             curve identifiers lateron (see ADD keyword), or if your
             last LABEL is a multi line entry (using the '!C' character).

        FRAME -> draw a frame around the legend box. The value of FRAME
             is equal to the color index that will be used to draw the
             FRAME (hence /FRAME draws a black frame with MYCT).

        BOXCOLOR -> a background fill color for the legend box. Default is
             0 (which corresponds to white in MYCT). If you specify a
             negative number, no background box is drawn and your legend 
             may interfere with part of the plot.

        ADD -> set this keyword to add one or more entries to an existing 
             legend. All positioning and size keywords are ignored in this
             case, and the new entries are appended at the bottom. You 
             should use the NLINES keyword in the first call to legend in
             order to properly size your legend box, or (if you draw
             no FRAME and have a neutral BOXCOLOR) you can set VALIGN to 
             e.g. 0.98 to start from the top of the plotting area. 
             Technical NOTE: adding entries to an existing legend is 
             most flexible with the use of the LEGSTRU keyword which will
             return a structure with all necessary parameters to continue
             labelling at the next call. It is also accomplished by means 
             of a common block to facilitate its use. In this case, you can
             only continue the legend you last worked on. 

        LEGSTRU -> a named variable that will contain information to
             continue labelling with the /ADD keyword. Needs to be passed
             back into LEGEND if it shall be used. Otherwise, information
             is taken from a common block.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        DRAWLEGSYM : plots a single plot symbol and line.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        LEGEND uses the STR_SIZE function by David Fanning 
        and FORMSTRLEN to determine "true" size of label strings.
        If ADD keyword is used, you also need CHKSTRU.

        A plot must have been produced prior to calling LEGEND

 NOTES:
        A few color statements require MYCT in the present form
        of this program. See definitions of variables Black and
        White at the beginning of the program.

 EXAMPLES:

             ; 1.2 and size the legend box automatically


        (4) 
        LEGEND, SYMBOL=[1,-1,6,-1,2,-1],      $
                LINE=[-1,0,-1,2,-1,3],        $

                CHARSIZE=1.2

              ; Draw a legend on a yellow background.  It has 6
              ; entries but leaves room for 2 more lines which 
              ; will be filled later.  Use different colors for 
              ; symbols and lines. Symbols and lines are alternating.
              ; Draw a frame around legend and add a title.

        (5)
        LEGEND, SYMBOL=[4,-1],                   $
                LINE=[-1,4],                     $
                COLOR=4,                         $
                LCOLOR=4,                        $

                /ADD
 
             ; Now add two extra entries to the last legend
             ; (This will use the structure stored in the 
             ; common block)
             ;
             ; To make use of the more flexible "widget-proof" 
             ; structure, simply add legstru=legstru to the last
             ; two calls.

             ; Produce an inset plot positioned via !P.POSITION 
             ; and add a legend.  The same effect can be reached 
             ; by passing the position=[..] parameter to the plot 
             ; command and the same vector as PLOTPOSITION to legend.

 NAME:
        LOCALTIME

 PURPOSE:
        Returns the local time at a particular location, given the
        Universal Time (aka Greenwich Time) and longitude.

 CATEGORY:
        Date & Time

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = LOCALTIME( UTC, LON )

 INPUTS:
        UTC -> Universal Time (aka Greenwich Time) in hours.
             UTC may be either a scalar or a vector.

        LON -> Longitude in degrees.  LON may be in the range
             -180..180 or 0..360.  LON may be either a scalar
             or a vector.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DOUBLE -> Set this switch to return local time in
             double precision.  Default is to return local time
             in single precision.
            
 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The local time corresponding to UTC and LON.
             If UTC and LON are vectors, then RESULT will also
             be a vector of local times.

 NAME:
        LOGLEVELS (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Compute default values for logarithmic axis labeling or 
        contour levels. For a range from 1 to 100 these would be 
        1., 2., 5., 10., 20., 50., 100.  If the range spans more 
        than (usually) 3 decades, only decadal values will be
        returned unless the /FINE keyword is set.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = LOGLEVELS( [ RANGE | MIN=MIN, MAX=MAX ] $
                            [,/FINE ] [ ,COARSE=DEC ] )

 INPUTS:
        RANGE -> A 2-element vector with the minimum and maximum 
            value to be returned. Only levels _within_ this range
            will be returned. If RANGE contains only one element,
            this is interpreted as MAX and MIN will be assumed as
            3 decades smaller. RANGE superseeds the MIN and MAX 
            keywords. Note that RANGE must be positive definite
            but can be given in descending order in which case
            the labels will be reversed.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MIN, MAX -> alternative way of specifying a RANGE. If only 
            one keyword is given, the other one is computed as
            3 decades smaller/larger than the given parameter.
            RANGE superseeds MIN and MAX.

        /FINE -> always return finer levels (1,2,5,...) 

        COARSE -> the maximum number of decades for which LOGLEVELS
            shall return fine labels. Default is 3. (non-integer 
            values are possible).

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> A vector with "round" logarithmic values within 
            the given range.  The original (or modified) RANGE will
            be returned unchanged if RANGE does not span at least 
            one label interval.  The result will always contain at 
            least two elements.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        If COARSE is lt 0, the nearest decades will be returned 
        instead. The result will always have at least two elements.
        If COARSE forces decades, the result values may be out-of-
        range if RANGE spans less than a decade.
        
        Caution with type conversion from FLOAT to DOUBLE !!

 EXAMPLE:
        RANGE   = [ MIN( DATA, MAX=M ), M ]
        C_LEVEL = LOGLEVELS( RANGE )
        CONTOUR, ..., C_LEVEL=C_LEVEL

             ; Define log levels for the CONTOUR command

 NAME:
        LOOP

 PURPOSE:
        This routine provides a wrapper for function calls that accept
        only scalars so that they can operate on arrays.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = LOOP( name, arg, p1, p2, p3, p4)

 INPUTS:
        NAME -> the name of the function (string)

        ARG -> the argument (array)

        P1 .. P4 -> optional function parameters 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        Unfortunately None. Would be nice if _EXTRA would work.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Vector with the same number of elements as ARG.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        A  = [ 0.05, 0.01, 0.001 ]
        PRINT, LOOP( "CHISQR_CVF", A, 17 )
          27.5871   33.4087   40.7903

             ; Define a vector of arguments and then then loop
             ; thru the vector, calling CHISQR_CVF each time.
             ; Then display the vector of results.
