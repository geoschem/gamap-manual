;==============================================================================
; Startup file for IDL -- customized for GAMAP 2.16+ (bmy, 6/8/12)
;
; This file is an batch file (i.e. it is a list of IDL statements as
; you would type them from the IDL> command prompt).  There are no
; "pro" and "end" statements, as there would be with regular IDL
; routines.  Also, compound IF statements are not allowed.
;==============================================================================

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The !PATH variable contains various system directories in which you would
; like IDL to search for source code routines.  We must insert the gamap2/
; directories up front so that IDL will search here before searching through
; the system directories.
;
; You may also add other directories in which you have IDL source code to
; the !PATH variable.  
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Call the IDL routine PATH_SEP to get the path separator token 
; (i.e. the character that you need to separate directories in !PATH). 
; This token is different depending on which OS you are using.
Sep     = Path_Sep( /Search_Path )

; Add directories to the !PATH variable.  Using IDL's EXPAND_PATH routine
; with the '+' sign will also cause any subdirectories to be added to the
; the !PATH variable.  
;
; The /ALL_DIRS flag will cause all subdirectories to be added to !PATH
; and not just the subdirectories containing *.pro files. 

; %%%%%%%%%% IDL 6.2 and later %%%%%%%%%%

; Use the PREF_SET command to append your directories into the default
; IDL search path.  This approach is necessary if you want to use the 
; IDLDE in IDL 7.0 and later versions. (phs, bmy, 4/15/08)
