bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                        - Adapted from "dial_ct.pro"
                        - Now can compress the colortable if
                          NCOLORS is less than N_ORIG
                        - Added /BuWhWhRd keyword for selecting
                          the BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED colortable
                        - Added /BuYlYlRd keyword for selecting
                          the BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED colortable

                          routine DEFINE_UserDef for selecting

                          NCOLORS lt NORIG.  It works fine with all 
                          the 4 diverging colortables, and keeps the 
                          doubling of the middle range color if NCOLORS 
                          is even and BuWhWhRd or BuYlYlRd is used. 
      bmy, 18 Apr 2008: - Bug fix: don't overwrite colortable name
                          for BuWhRd colortable
