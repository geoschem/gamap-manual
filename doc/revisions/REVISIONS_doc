ADD_TEMPLATE.PRO
===================
     written by:
        R. Sterner, about Sep 1989 at Sac Peak.  The exact date was
             probably lost by this routine itself.
     modified:
        R. Sterner, 13 Dec, 1993 --- dropped spawn to copy files.
        R. Sterner, 11 Mar, 1993 --- handled no help text case.
        M. Schultz, 01 Aug, 1997 --- simplified version without
             analyzing help text
             Also, original file is left intact 
             (i.e. modification date etc.)
             and renamed file.backup if operation successfully.
             OF COURSE the copyright note is changed as well
