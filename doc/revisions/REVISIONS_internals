                - reads in file header
                - returns structure instead of string array
                - always returns all entries, filtering must be done later
      mgs, 03 Mar 1998: - now returns a structure and is a function

                - automatic EXTRA_SPACE detection
                - fileinfo structure not created any more, and only
                  extended if present (chkstru)

      bmy, 16 Sep 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                        - Convert some global attributes to number

                          saved to the netCDF file as strings
      phs, 15 Sep 2009: - Added check on reading tracerinfo.dat
                        - Convert some tracer names created by

                          from a netCDF variable attribute (if present)
      bmy, 19 Dec 2011: - Generalized to handle several different
                          vertical levels
      bmy, 21 Dec 2011: - Now will interpret netCDF attributes
                          "begin_date" and "begin_time" in the same
                          way as "start_date" and "start_time"
      bmy, 22 Dec 2011: - Now compute FIRST (nested datablock offsets)
                          properly for nested grids.  For now assume
                          that the data will always start on the first
                          vertical level.
                        - Bug fix: test for Latrev gt 0 to avoid

      bmy, 03 Jan 2012: - Skip over Ap and Bp index arrays
                        - Now use better error checks for
                          the time and vertical level dimensions

                          correctly when specified in hhmmss format.
      bmy, 10 Jan 2012: - Fix to interpret data blocks with multiple 
                          vertical dimensions in the same file 
      bmy, 13 Jan 2012: - When the time dimension in the netCDF
                          file is 1 (esp. when time is an UNLIMITED
                          variable, we need to add a fake dimension
                          of 1 back onto the data block to avoid
                          crashes.  This is a quirk in how the IDL
                          NCDF_VARGET function works.

TVIMAGE.PRO
===================
    Written by:     David Fanning, 20 NOV 1996.
    Fixed a small bug with the resizing of the image. 17 Feb 1997. DWF.
    Removed BOTTOM and NCOLORS keywords. This reflects my growing belief
       that this program should act more like TV and less like a "color
       aware" application. I leave "color awareness" to the program
       using TVIMAGE. Added 24-bit image capability. 15 April 1997. DWF.
    Fixed a small bug that prevented this program from working in the
        Z-buffer. 17 April 1997. DWF.
    Fixed a subtle bug that caused me to think I was going crazy!
        Lession learned: Be sure you know the *current* graphics
        window! 17 April 1997. DWF.
    Added support for the PRINTER device. 25 June 1997. DWF.
    Extensive modifications. 27 Oct 1997. DWF
        1) Removed PRINTER support, which didn't work as expected.
        2) Modified Keep_Aspect_Ratio code to work with POSITION keyword.
        3) Added check for window-able devices (!D.Flags AND 256).
        4) Modified PostScript color handling.
    Craig Markwart points out that Congrid adds an extra row and column
        onto an array. When viewing small images (e.g., 20x20) this can be
        a problem. Added a Minus_One keyword whose value can be passed
        along to the Congrid keyword of the same name. 28 Oct 1997. DWF
    Changed default POSITION to fill entire window. 30 July 1998. DWF.
    Made sure color decomposition is OFF for 2D images. 6 Aug 1998. DWF.
    Added limited PRINTER portrait mode support. The correct aspect ratio
        of the image is always maintained when outputting to the
        PRINTER device and POSITION coordinates are ignored. 6 Aug 1998. DWF
    Removed 6 August 98 fixes (Device, Decomposed=0) after realizing that
        they interfere with operation in the Z-graphics buffer. 9 Oct 1998. DWF
    Added a MARGIN keyword. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
    Re-established Device, Decomposed=0 keyword for devices that
       support it. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
    Added support for the !P.Multi system variable. 3 March 99. DWF
    Added DEVICE, DECOMPOSED=1 command for all 24-bit images. 2 April 99. DWF.
    Added ability to preserve DECOMPOSED state for IDL 5.2 and higher. 4 April 99. DWF.
    Added TV keyword to allow TVIMAGE to work like the TV command. 11 May 99. DWF.
    Added the OVERPLOT keyword to allow plotting on POSITION coordinates
       estabished by the preceding graphics command. 11 Oct 99. DWF.
    Added automatic recognition of !P.Multi. Setting MULTI keyword is no
       longer required. 18 Nov 99. DWF.
    Added NOINTERPOLATION keyword so that nearest neighbor interpolation
       is performed rather than bilinear. 3 Dec 99. DWF
    Changed ON_ERROR condition from 1 to 2. 19 Dec 99. DWF.
    Added Craig Markwardt's CMCongrid program and removed RSI's. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
    Added HALF_HALF keyword to support CMCONGRID. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
    Fixed a small problem with image start position by adding ROUND function. 19 March 2000. DWF.
    Updated the PRINTER device code to take advantage of available keywords. 2 April 2000. DWF.
    Reorganized the code to handle 24-bit images on 8-bit displays better. 2 April 2000. DWF.
    Added BACKGROUND keyword. 20 April 2000. DWF.
    Fixed a small problem in where the ERASE was occuring. 6 May 2000. DWF.
    Rearranged the PLOT part of code to occur before decomposition state
       is changed to fix Background color bug in multiple plots. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
    Removed MULTI keyword, which is no longer needed. 23 Sept 2000. DWF.
    Fixed a small problem with handling images that are slices from 3D image cubes. 5 Oct 2000. DWF.
    Added fix for brain-dead Macs from Ben Tupper that restores Macs ability to
       display images. 8 June 2001. DWF.
    Fixed small problem with multiple plots and map projections. 29 June 2003. DWF.
    Converted all array subscripts to square brackets. 29 June 2003. DWF.
    Removed obsolete STR_SEP and replaced with STRSPLIT. 27 Oct 2004. DWF.
    Small modification at suggestion of Karsten Rodenacker to increase size of
       images in !P.MULTI mode. 8 December 2004. DWF.
    Minor modifications on Karsten Rodenacker's own account concerning margination
       and TV behaviour. 8 December 2004. KaRo
    There was a small inconsistency in how the image was resized for PostScript as
       opposed to the display, which could occasionally result in a small black line
       to the right of the image. This is now handled consistently. 3 January 2007. DWF.
    Made a small change to CMCONGRID to permit nearest-neighbor interpolation for 3D arrays.
       Previously, any 24-bit image was interpolated, no matter the setting of the NOINTERP
       keyword. 22 April 2007. DWF.
    Updated the program for the 24-bit Z-buffer in IDL 6.4. 11 June 2007. DWF.
    Added new POSITION keyword functionality for !P.MULTI display. 9 Sept 2007. DWF.
