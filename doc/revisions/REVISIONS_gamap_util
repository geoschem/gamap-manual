                          more generic global update procedure !
      mgs, 03 Dec 1998: - yet another bug fix in reopen files: needed
                          to test for negative ilun before fstat
      bmy, 21 Jan 1999: - added outer parentheses to the FORMAT
                          descriptor (255(I4,1x)) to avoid errors
      mgs, 17 Feb 1999: - bug fix for simple diagnostics: needed
                          to add dummy value to compound array.
      mgs, 16 Mar 1999: - catch error in tracerinfo.dat (more than one
                          tracer with same number)
                        - error in update_tracer... should have been
                          fixed. Some more debug output added for 
                          testing.

                        - Now reference function LITTLE_ENDIAN
                        - Swap endian in OPEN_FILE if reading data
                          on a little-endian machine (e.g. PC) 
      bmy, 19 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                        - now test valid diagnostics using 
                          DIAGSTRU[*].CATEGORY and not DIAGSTRU[*].INDEX
                        - removed /SMALLCHEM keyword, it's obsolete
                        - Now recognizes binary files as having
                          FILETYPE values between 100 and 200
                        - Removed /SMALLCHEM flag, it's obsolete
                        - Now uses diagnostic spacing from CTM_DIAGINFO
                          and pass this to UPDATE_TRACER_DIAGINFO
      bmy, 11 Feb 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.01a

                          now passes SPACING from CTM_DIAGINFO
                          to routine CTM_DOSELECT_DATA
      bmy, 27 Oct 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                        - added QUIET keyword to suppress printing
                          information about retrieved tracers
      bmy, 06 Feb 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                        - Bug fix: use DIALOG_PICKFILE to get file name
                          before calling CTM_OPEN_FILE.  This is necessary
                          because the tests for certain file types requires
                          the file name to be known ahead of time.
bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                        - now passes _EXTRA keyword to
                          CTM_OPEN_FILE. This allows to read nested 
                          met (GMAO) files by using /NA or /CHINA
bmy & phs, 20 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                        - If FILENAME is not defined, then the value
                          of the filename selected via dialog box
                          will be passed back to the calling program.
NOWN BUGS OR WEAKNESSES:
      - handling of USE_DATAINFO and USE_FILEINFO is not carried 
        through all lower level subroutines, i.e. they may be replaced
        by *pGlobal... in some occasions. Since USE_... should always
        be a subset of *pGlobal..., no serious errors are expected
        from this weakness. 
      - known bug in update_tracer_datainfo, see comment in routine.

                          GAMAP_SelectDataBlock, and
                          GAMAP_QueryAverageOrTotal
                        - updated comments
      bmy, 17 Feb 1999: VERSION 1.20
                        - Replace DATAINFO.OFFSET by DATAINFO.FIRST,
                          which contains the I, J, L indices of

                        - removed /ANIMATE keyword

                          grid box edges
                        - warn user if lat range contains half-polar
                          boxes, since TVIMAGE will treat them as
                          whole boxes and the map overlay will be
                          inaccurate!

      mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added ALREADY_PS flag for multi-panel use
                        - animation now only if !p.multi does not

                        - removed unnecessary function MatchFileInfo...
                          (easier with make_selection)

                        - some adjustments in FindNearestEdges, notably
                          for range 0..360. Unfortunately, the 0 meridian
                          gridline will be omitted in such plots. If we
                          wanted to include it we would need to carry
                          an extra GLOBAL flag because lower and upper
                          edges (grid box indices) are identical.
      mgs, 20 May 1999: - added option to save record seelction to file.
      mgs, 24 May 1999: - yet more work had to be done to make lon/lat

                          to -88..88 only for "reset" conditions. Otherwise
                          -90..90 is recognized and remembered.

                          pixel-maps appear smoother
                        - a border is now plotted around the
                          map window, without inserting any of that
                          annoying "cushion" space.
                        - added LOG keyword for logarithmic

      mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added multi-panel ability through use of
                          the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                          meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now

                          higher above the window, to allow for
                          carriage-returned lines
      mgs, 23 Apr 1999: - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for
                          tighter colorbar control

                          no lines.
      bmy, 03 Jun 1999: - For polar plots, if the latitude range
                          spans more than 60 degrees, only plot
                          labels for [ 30, 60, 90 ] degrees.
      mgs, 03 Jun 1999: - CFill now also allowed for filled contours
                          or pixel plots (data will be overplotted)
      bmy, 09 Jun 1999: - Set CBUnit to '' if nothing passed
      bmy, 21 Jun 1999: - Added MIN_VALID keyword.
      bmy, 06 Jul 1999: - bug fix for min_valid: ge replaces gt.
      bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                          define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                          appear in Postscript plots
                        - multi-panel plots are now well-separated

      bmy, 26 May 2000: - updated comments
      bmy, 13 Jun 2000: - added /COUNTRIES and /COASTS keywords.
                          Setting /COUNTRIES, /COASTS, or /CONTINENTS
                          will now invoke routine MAP_CONTINENTS
      bmy, 30 Jan 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.47
                        - if NOGLABELS=0 and GRID=0, will print out
                          grid labels w/o printing out grid lines
                        - added MARGIN keyword for MULTIPANEL

      bmy, 02 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48
                        - added /NOGXLABELS and /NOGYLABELS keywords
                          to suppress printing either lon or lat
                          grid labels, if so desired.
      bmy, 13 Jul 2001: - bug fix: remove _EXTRA=e from MAP_SET call
                          when making pixel plots.  This prevents extra
                          grid lines from being drawn on the map.
      bmy, 23 Jul 2001: - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                          values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                          if these keywords are not passed explicitly.

                        - If the data array has more than 100,000 elements,
                          then assign it a dithering factor of 1, so that
                          we don't run out of memory when trying to plot it
      bmy, 20 Jun 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                        - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword to return
                          the position vector of the plot window
                          region to the calling program
      bmy, 28 Sep 2002: - now gets MYCT default parameters from the
                          !MYCT system variable
      bmy, 10 Oct 2002: - bug fix: MCOLOR=!MYCT.BLACK setting has
                          now been restored (was left commented out)
      bmy, 14 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                        - If GLABELS=0, then this also sets GXLABELS=0
                          and GYLABELS=0.
                        - Removed obsolete keywords
                        - Removed reference to MYCT_DEFAULTS.
      bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                        - added OMARGIN keyword so that we can put
                          an outer margin around all plot panels
      bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                          C_COLORS to the calling program
                        - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the
                          color bar tick length

                        - added MAX_VALID keyword
                        - now adjust MINDATA to MIN_VALID and
                          MAXDATA to MAX_VALID internally
                        - Now pass _EXTRA=e to XYOUTS
tmf & bmy, 04 Oct 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.05
                        - Replace /ERASE keyword with /NOERASE
                          to facilitate manual positioning of
                          plots.  Pass /NOERASE to MULTIPANEL.
bmy & phs, 18 Sep 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                        - Don't reset data below MIN_VALID to

                          are taken into account in Pixel
                          plot: no more need to clip the data
                          before plotting, TVMAP will do it, like
                          it already does for Contour plots.
                        - added Full Hemisphere Polar plot option,
                          regardless of DATA range and LIMIT keyword
                        - added RECTANGLE keyword to overwrite
                          default behavior
                        - map plotting coordinate system active at

                        - The test for the LIMIT keyword is now to check
                          "if ( n_elements(limit) ne 4 )".  This allows you
                          to disable the LIMIT keyword by also setting
                          LIMIT=0.

                        - LONS and LATS keyword added, so the grid can
                          be specified. Work with DLAT and DLON, the
                          grid spacings that can be passed to MAP_LABELS
                          thru the _extra keyword.
cdh & phs, 21 Mar 2008: - added minimum support for LIMIT input as
                          8-elements vector
      phs, 17 Apr 2008: - Added the TopOutOfRange and BotOutOfRange
                          keywords, so default color (white) for Out-Of
                          -Range data can be overwritten.
      phs,  6 May 2008: - Added the GXLABELS and GYLABELS keywords
                          to specify which grid line to label.
      phs, 19 Jun 2008: - Set default SCALE value for MapImage
                          (ScaleMapImage keyword) to 0.04 if PS device.
      phs, 25 Mar 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                        - Added NAN_COLOR to specify color to use
                          for NaN and Infinite data 
dh, eml, phs, 19 Sep 2009: - Now C_LEVELS works with pixel plots and
                          any projection.
                        - Added LATS, LONS (to specify the grid), and
                          TOPLEVELVALUE (to specify the last level
                          in the colorbar when using C_LEVELS)
                          keywords
                        - fixed limit of CONUS projection
      phs, 29 Oct 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.14
                        - added the polyfill keyword

===================
TVPLOT.PRO
===================
      bmy, 27 Apr 1998:  VERSION 1.00
      bmy, 04 Jun 1998:  - now can plot separate X or Y axes
                           if [XY]STYLE = 4 or 8
      mgs, 15 Jun 1998:  - bug fix n_elements instead of keyword_set
                         - now does spline interpolation in the
                           vertical in order to get correct
                           altitudes
      bmy, 21 Sep 1998:  - Rename EXTRA1, EXTRA2, etc, to names
                           that have more meaning (e.g. E_BYT for
                           BytScl, E_TV for TVImage, etc.)
      bmy, 22 Sep 1998:  VERSION 1.10
                         - now uses _EXTRA=e facility to pass extra
                           keywords to BYTSCL, TVIMAGE, PLOT, and
                           COLORBAR.
                         - add PLOTTITLE (for PLOT) and UNIT (for
                           COLORBAR) keywords to prevent keyword
                           name duplication in _EXTRA=e.
      mgs, 11 Nov 1998:  - added CBar keyword
      bmy, 16 Nov 1998:  VERSION 2.00
                         - now can produce line-contour and filled-
                           contour plots as well as image plots
                         - now calls REBIN to rebin the byte-scaled
                           image array to higher resolution for
                           PostScript output.
                         - added the following keywords: /LOG,
                           /SAMPLE, /CONTOUR, /FCONTOUR, C_ANNOTATION,
                           C_LEVELS, C_LABELS, /NOLABELS, /NOLINES, 
      bmy, 17 Nov 1998:  - For image plots, now only display plot axes
                           AFTER the image plot has been made.  This
                           reduces the "apparent" wait time for the 
                           user.
                         - renamed keywords to XA_TITLE, XA_RANGE, 
                           XA_TICKNAME, etc to avoid keyword name
                           duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.
      mgs, 17 Nov 1998:  - added CBFormat keyword
      bmy, 18 Nov 1998:  - also added floating point format for 
                           CBFORMAT when abs(max(Data)) < 10
      mgs, 19 Nov 1998:  - CBFormat no whandled in colorbar.pro
      bmy, 27 Jan 1999:  - added defaults for XRANGE and YRANGE
      bmy, 08 Jan 1999:  - If /LOG is set, make sure that we don't
                           take the log of zero and incur a math error
                         - add call to function INV_INDEX  
      mgs, 18 Mar 1999:  - cleaned up
                         - now uses loglevels and has smarter default 
                           contour levels
      mgs, 22 Mar 1999:  - added multi-panel ability through use of
                           the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                           meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now
                           refer to positions in the current plot panel!
      mgs, 23 Mar 1999:  - fixed a few minor things
                         - charsize is now adjusted according to number
                           of panels on page
      bmy, 25 Mar 1999:  - now use updated GET_DEFAULTFORMAT
                         - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                           higher above the window, to allow for 
                           carriage-returned lines
                         - updated comments
      bmy, 27 Apr 1999:  - commented out !x.charsize=csfac and
                           !y.charsize=csfac lines...these messed
                           up the plot window sizes
                         - updated comments
      bmy, 28 Apr 1999:  - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for 
                           tighter colorbar control
      mgs, 19 May 1999: - title shifted a little higher if it has
                          more than 1 line.
      mgs, 21 May 1999: - variable name for TITLE now MTITLE as in
                          TVMAP.
      mgs, 27 May 1999: - changed default behaviour for filled contours:
                          now plots "discrete" colorbar and no lines.
                          Keyword NoLines changed to C_Lines.
      bmy, 10 Jun 1999: - CBUnit defaults to '
      mgs, 06 Jul 1999: - adjusted charsize for multipanel plots
      bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                          define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                          appear in Postscript plots
                        - multi-panel plots are now well-separated
                          from each other (for PostScript output)
      bmy, 08 Jul 1999: - more minor fixes
      bmy, 18 Nov 1999: - increase default left margin by a little
      bmy, 31 Mar 2000: GAMAP VERSION 1.45
                        - made CSFAC a keyword
      bmy, 23 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48
                        - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                          values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                          if these keywords are not passed explicitly.
      bmy, 07 Jul 2001: - removed obsolete code from 1998 and 1999
      bmy, 31 Oct 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.49
                        - add /NOADVANCE keyword to prevent advancing
                          to the next page (in case you want to overplot)
      bmy, 28 Sep 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                        - now gets MYCT default parameters from the
                          !MYCT system variable
      bmy, 15 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                        - Added MIN_VALID keyword to skip missing
                          data values for pixel plots
      bmy, 18 Dec 2003: - For pixel plots, now linearly interpolate
                          when creating NDATA instead of using a
                          cubic spline.  This is more accurate.
                        - Prevent NDATA from being extrapolated wildly
                          due to the slope at the surface and top level
                          of the plot.  
      bmy, 06 Jan 2003: - Now interpolate NDATA correctly when pressure
                          or altitude is on the Y-axis.
                        - Removed obsolete keywords XA_TITLE, YA_TITLE,
                        - XA_RANGE, YA_RANGE, XA_TICKNAME, YA_TICKNAME
                        - Now define default YRANGE = [ ZBOT, ZTOP ]
                          to make Y-axis labels correct for both pressure
                          and altitude on the Y-axis.
                        - Removed ZBOT, ZTOP from the keyword list; 
                          these are now internal variables. 
                        - updated comments
      bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                        - added MARGIN keyword a la TVMAP
                        - added OMARGIN keyword
      bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                          C_COLORS to the calling program
                        - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the
                          color bar tick length
      bmy, 30 Nov 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                        - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword  
      bmy, 12 Jul 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                        - added /ISOTROPIC keyword
                        - added /NOZINTERP keyword to prevent interpolation
                          to a fine grid of 100 pts in the vertical dim.
bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
bmy & phs, 26 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                        - Minor fix for margins w/ for new TVIMAGE
                        - Also reset !P.MULTI=0 when using TVIMAGE
                          so that it will use the internally computed
                          position vector.  Reset after TVIMAGE call.
                        - Make sure to label last colorbar division
                          for contour plots
                        - Vertical colorbar options and MIN_VALID, 
                          MAX_VALID keywords are the same as TVMAP
                        - Extra space is now added to the default
                          MARGIN values for vertical colorbar
                          and multiple plots per page.
                        - Adjust default CBPOSITION values such
                          that the colorbar will be placed either
                          0.05 below or 0.02 to the right of the plot
      phs, 04 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                        - now produces a better coarse pixel plot
                          for altitude vs latitude or longitude
                          plots, even though the initial box size
                          is not exactly reproduced. 
dh, eml, phs, 24 Sep 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                        - fixes for LOG10 plots
                        - new improved interpolation scheme in Z
                          direction
                        - C_LEVELS works with /SAMPLE
                        - added checks on NAN when looking at
                          min/max, added NAN_COLOR to specify a
                          color for NaN
                        - added BOTOUTOFRANGE to set color of data
                          below Min_Valid
                        - check if !MYCT is defined
yue & bmy, 24 Jan 2011: GAMAP VERSION 2.15
                        - Replace /ERASE keyword with /NOERASE
                          to facilitate manual positioning of
                          plots.  Pass /NOERASE to MULTIPANEL.
                          This is now consistent w/ TVMAP.
