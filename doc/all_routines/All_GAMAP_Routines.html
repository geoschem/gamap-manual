 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       written by:
          R. Sterner, about Sep 1989 at Sac Peak.  The exact date was
               probably lost by this routine itself.
       modified:
          R. Sterner, 13 Dec, 1993 --- dropped spawn to copy files.
          R. Sterner, 11 Mar, 1993 --- handled no help text case.
          M. Schultz, 01 Aug, 1997 --- simplified version without
               analyzing help text
               Also, original file is left intact 
               (i.e. modification date etc.)
               and renamed file.backup if operation successfully.
               OF COURSE the copyright note is changed as well 
          mgs, 09 Oct 1998 : - added Id tag for RCS
          bmy, 19 Jul 1999 : - changed name & email from mgs to bmy
                               for convenience!  :-)
          bmy, 27 Jul 1999 : - put RCS tag as the first line of
                               the standard header
          bmy, 06 Jul 2000 : - extended separator lines a bit
          bmy, 11 Oct 2006 : TOOLS VERSION 2.05
                             - Cosmetic chanes
     bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                             - Now include 2 email addresses
                             - Updated comments, cosmetic changes.
                             - Same conditions apply
           bmy, 22 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12

 NAME:
        ARREX  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        This function extracts a multi-dimensional subset
        of an array. For each dimension the start index,
        end index, and stride can be specified - default values
        are 0 (i.e. first start index), "all" (i.e. last end
        index), and 1 (i.e. every element). A negative stride
        causes reversion of the respective array dimension.

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Result = ARREX(Array [, Starti [,Endi [, Stride ]]] [,/Reform])

 INPUTS:
        ARRAY -> The parent array from which the extraction shall be made.
            Currently up to 4 dimensions are supported.

        STARTI -> An array with starting indices. Each element of STARTI
            corresponds to one dimension of ARRAY. If STARTI has less
            elements than ARRAY dimensions, the remainder is assumed 0.

        ENDI   -> An array with ending indices. Each element of ENDI
            corresponds to one dimension of ARRAY. If ENDI has less
            elements than ARRAY dimensions, the remainder is set to the
            maximum possible value for that dimension.

        STRIDE -> An array with stride values. A stride of 1 (default)
            signifies extraction of every element, 2 returns every 
            second element for that dimension, etc. Negative values
            cause the respective dimension to be reversed. 
            Each value of STRIDE corresponds to one dimension of ARRAY. 
            If STRIDE has less elements than ARRAY dimensions, the 
            remainder is assumed 1.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /REFORM -> Set this keyword to eliminate unnecessary dimensions
            in the result.

 OUTPUTS:
        A subset of the original array. This will have the same

 NAME:
        ARROWMAP

 PURPOSE:
        Plots a vector field atop a world map.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        ARROWMAP, U, V, X, Y [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        U, V -> The X and Y components of the two-dimensional vector
             field.  U and V must be two-dimensional arrays.

             The vector at point (i,j) has a magnitude of:             
             
                       ( U(i,j)^2 + V(i,j)^2 )^0.5             
             
             and a direction of:             
             
                       ATAN2( V(i,j), U(i,j) ).             
             
        X, Y -> Longitude (X) and latitude (Y) values corresponding to 
             the U and V arrays.  X must be a vector with a length equal 
             to the 1st dimension of U and V.  Y must be a vector
             with length equal to the 2nd dimension of U and V.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        UNIT -> String containing the units for the plot legend.
             Default is '' (the null string).

        FORMAT -> Format string for the arrow legend.  Default
             is '(f10.3)'.

        TITLE -> Top title for the map panel.  
             Default is '' (the null string).

        CSFAC -> Character size for the map labels and X, Y titles. 
             Default settings for CSFAC vary according to the number 
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        TCSFAC -> Character size for the top title.  Default
             settings for TCSFAC vary according to the number 
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords (not listed below) for
             ARROW, MAP_SET, MAP_GRID, MAP_CONTINENTS, VELOCITY_FIELD.

    Keywords for MAP_SET:
    =====================
        MPARAM -> A 3 element vector containing values for
             [ P0Lat, P0Lon, Rot ].  Default is [ 0, 0, 0 ].
             Elements not specified are automatically set to zero.

             NOTE: If X contains positive longitudes (i.e. in the 
             range 0-360), then set MPARAM = [0, 180, 0].  This will
             ensure that the map is displayed correctly.

        LIMIT -> A four-element vector which specifies the latitude
             and longitude extent of the map.  The elements of LIMIT
             are arranged thus: [ LatMin, LonMin, LatMax, LonMax ].
             Default is to set LIMIT = [ -90, -180, 90, 180 ] (i.e.
             to include the entire globe). P0Lon will be computed
             to fit into the LIMIT range unless it is explicitely
             requested in MParam.

             If LIMIT is not passed explicitly, then LIMIT will be
             computed from the maximum and minimum values of the 
             X and Y vectors.

        COLOR -> Color index of the map outline and flow vectors.
             Defaults is 1 (MYCT black color).

        /POLAR -> Plot a polar stereographic projection. 
             NOTE: Polar is not yet supported (bmy, 5/26/00)

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot.
             Default is [0.0, 0.15, 1.0, 1.0].

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized 
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible" 
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in
            subsequent plot commands.  MARGIN can either be one value 
            which will be applied to all four margins, or a 2-element 
            vector which results in equal values for the left and
            right and equal values for the bottom and top margins, 
            or a 4-element vector with [left,bottom,right,top].  The
            default MARGIN setting is [ 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.07 ].

        /ISOTROPIC  -> If set, will produce a map with the same scale
             in the X and Y directions.  Default is not to plot an
             isotropic-scale map. Note, however, that if TVMAP is 
             called from CTM_PLOT, the default is to plot a map that
             keeps the aspect ratio (which is about the same as 
             isotropic).


    Keywords for MAP_CONTINENTS:
    ============================
        /CONTINENTS -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to plot
             continent outlines or filled boundaries.  Default is 0.

        CCOLOR -> The color index of the continent outline or fill
             region.  Default is 1 (MYCT black color).

        CFILL -> Value passed to FILL_CONTINENTS keyword of MAP_CONTINENTS.
             If CFILL=1 then will fill continents with a solid color
             (as specified in CCOLOR above).  If CFILL=2 then will fill
             continents with hatching.

    Keywords for MAP_GRID:
    ======================
        /GRID -> If set, will call MAP_GRID to plot grid lines and
             labels.  Default is NOT to plot grid lines and labels.

        GCOLOR -> The color index of the grid lines. Default is
             BLACK (see above).

    Keywords for VELOCITY_FIELD:
    ============================
        ACOLOR -> Specifies the color of the arrows.  Default is black.
 
        HSIZE -> The length of the lines used to draw the arrowhead.
             If HSIZE is positive, then the arrow head will be the
             same regardless of the length of each vector.  (Default
             size is !D.X_SIZE / 100).  If HSIZE is negative, then
             the arrowhead will be 1/HSIZEth of the total arrow length.

        THICK -> Thickness factor for the arrows.  Default is 2.0.

        MAXMAG -> Returns to the calling program the magnitude of the
             longest vector. 

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =====================================
        MULTIPANEL   MYCT_DEFAULTS (function)
        MAP_LABELS   VELOCITY_FIELD

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) The U and V arrays may contain either CTM winds or 
            flux quantities.  However, when plotting fluxes, it is 
            STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you double-check the units of
            U and V before passing them to ARROWMAP.  Some unit 
            conversion may be required in order to display fluxes
            properly.

        (2) If your map spans the date line, then do the following:

              (a) Make sure that your longitudes are in the range 
                  0 - 360 degrees

              (b) Call ARROWMAP with MPARAM=[0,180,0] in order to 
                  have MAP_SET accept longitudes in the range 0-360.

 EXAMPLE:
        ARROWMAP, U, V, X, Y, $
            /GRID, /CONTINENTS, THICK=3, CFILL=2, GCOLOR=1, UNIT='m/s'

            ; Plots a vector flow pattern over a world map.  Continents 
            ; are filled to a solid red color (assuming a MYCT colortable).  
            ; Arrows have a thickness factor of 3.

 NAME:
        BARGRAPH

 PURPOSE:
        Creates a bar graph from a vector of data points.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BARGRAPH, DATA, BASELINE [,keywords]

 INPUTS
        DATA -> Vector of data points to be plotted as a bargraph.
 
        BASELINE -> Vector of points to be used as a baseline for 
             DATA (i.e., Y(I) = DATA(I) + BASELINE(I) ).  If BASELINE 
             is not specified, its default value will be an array 
             of zeroes.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /OVERPLOT -> Set this switch to prevent the current plot
             window from being erased.  This is useful for producing 
             stacked bar plots with successive calls to BARGRAPH.
 
        BARWIDTH -> The width of the bars.  If BARWIDTH is not
            specified, its default value will be 1.0.

        BARCOLOR -> a value or an array containing the colorindex for
            all boxes or each box, respectively. If a single value
            is given, *all* boxes will have this color. If an array 
            is passed that has less elements than there are groups to 
            plot, the remaining colors will be filled with 15 (grey 
            in MYCT standard-scheme).  

        BARLABELS -> A string array of labels to be plotted above each
            bar.  If BARLABELS may be originally set equal to the
            DATA vector, and it will be converted to the string 
            representation of DATA, using the FORMAT statement 
            contained in L_FORMAT.

        BARCHARSIZE -> Character size for BARLABELS.  Default is 1.0.

        COLOR -> Color index for the plot axes and labels.  
            Default is !MYCT.BLACK.

        L_FORMAT -> The FORMAT statement used to convert BARLABELS
            from a numeric array to a string array.

        /NO_LABELS -> Set this switch to suppress printing the labels
            contained in the BARLABELS atop each bar.  This is useful 
            for producing stacked bar plots.

        XLABELS -> A string array containing the labels that will be 
            printed underneath each bar on the X-axis.  

            NOTE: If /HORIZONTAL is set, then these labels will be 
            printed along the Y-axis instead.

            ALSO NOTE: IDL only allows a maximum limit of 60 ticks 
            along any axis.  If XLABELS has more than 58 elements
            (also allowing for null labels at the beginning and end
            of the plot range), then the labels will not be printed.

        YRANGE -> Use this keyword to specify the range of the data 
            values.  If YRANGE is not specified, then YRANGE will be 
            computed based on the maximum value of the DATA array.  
            For stacked plots, it is useful to compute YRANGE in the 
            calling program and pass it to BARGRAPH. 

            NOTE: If HORIZONTAL is set, then the YRANGE settings 
            will apply to the X-axis instead.

        /HORIZONTAL -> Set this switch to plot the bars in the 
            horizontal instead of in the vertical.  NOTE: In this
            case, the YRANGE settings will be applied to the X-axis.
            and the XRANGE and XLABELS settings will be applied to
            the Y-axis.

        YFACTOR -> Use this to add space between the bar and bar label.
            This will multiply DATA + BASELINE by a factor that you
            specify.  Default is 1.01.

        _EXTRA=e -> Passes extra keywords to PLOT and other routines.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None
        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine has been modified to be more general and 
            more robust than the original version in the IDL 5.0 
            User's Guide (p. 170).

        (2) IDL 5.x array notation [] is now used.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)

        BARGRAPH, [1,2,3], BARWIDTH=1.0, BARCOLOR=[10,11,12]
           XLABELS=['Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie']

             ; Create a simple bar graph with bars of 3 different 
             ; colors, using a baseline of zero.

        (2)

        DATA   = [2,3.5,6,7,2,1]
        DATA2  = 0.0*DATA + 2

        BARGRAPH, DATA, XLABELS=['A','B','C','D','E','F'],  $
           XSTYLE=1, BARWIDTH=0.8

        BARGRAPH, DATA2, DATA, BARWIDTH=0.8 ,/OVERPLOT, $
           BARCOLOR=2, BARLABELS=DATA+DATA2, L_FORMAT='(F8.2)'             


             ; Use successive calls to BARGRAPH to create a 
             ; "stacked" bar graph with two different data vectors.  
             ; The first vector is used as the baseline for the
             ; second.  The BARLABELS array is created from the actual 
             ; data values.

        (3) 

        BARGRAPH, [1,2,3], BARWIDTH=1.0, BARCOLOR=[10,11,12]
           XLABELS=['Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie'], /HORIZONTAL

             ; Same as example (1), but plot bars in the horizontal.

 NAME:
        BOXPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        Produce a box and whisker plot of a data vector

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BOXPLOT,DATA [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA  --> the data vector

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        GROUP --> array of the same dimension as DATA which contains
             grouping information. One box is plotted for each group.
             If MINGROUP or MAXGROUP are given, boxes and whiskers are
             only plotted for group values within this range.
             GROUP may not contain more than 28 different values.
             Group can also be a string array. In this case MINGROUP
             and MAXGROUP make no sense of course.

        MINGROUP --> the minimum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        MAXGROUP --> the maximum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        LABEL --> string array containing labels for *different* groups.
             NOTE: The user must take care that one label is passed for
             each group to be plotted. If label is not specified, the
             group values will be used as axis labels

        COLOR --> plotting color for axis (default : 1, i.e. black in MYCT
             color scheme). Will also be used as default for BOXCOLOR.

        BOXCOLOR --> color of the boxes (frames). Default is the COLOR
             value, i.e. 1 if not specified. This color will also be used as
             default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR. If you want boxes that 
             are only filled but have no frame, you must specify BOXCOLOR=-1.
             In this case the default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR will
             be the COLOR value.

        BOXWIDTH --> relative width of boxes (default: 0.8).

        BOXPOSITION --> relative position of box on x axis (default: 0.).
             This parameter can be used together with the OVERPLOT keyword
             to plot multiple groups of boxes in one graph.

        MEDIANCOLOR --> a color value for the median bar
             (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        MEANSYMBOL --> symbol to be used for mean values. If no symbol
             is given, no mean values will be drawn.

        MEANCOLOR --> color for mean symbols (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        FILLCOLOR --> a value or an array containing the colorindex for all
             boxes or each box, respectively. If a single value is given,
             *all* boxes will be filled with this color. If an array is 
             passed that has less elements than there are groups to plot, 
             the remaining colors will be filled with 15 (grey in MYCT 
             standard-scheme). If no FILLCOLOR is specified, the boxes will 
             be empty.

        MISSING --> a value that represents missing data. If given, any data
             with a value of missing will be filtered out before plotting.

        PRINTN --> print number of elements on top of each box/whisker

        CHARSIZE --> character size of the PRINTN labels (default: 0.8)

        /OVERPLOT --> do not draw a new coordinate system but overlay new
             data. For 2 sets of data you should use BOXWIDTH=0.4 and
             BOXPOSITION=-0.25 and 0.25, respectively.

        ORIENTATION -> orientation for axis labels (see XYOUTS procedure)

        /IS_PERCENTILE --> data are already processed percentiles. In this
             case data must be an array with dimensions 5,N. The GROUP keyword
             is ignored, and each set of the N percentiles will be treated as
             one group.

        PERCVAL --> float array with 5 elements denoting the percentile
             values (default: 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95)

        Further keywords are passed to the PLOT routine and can be used
        to determine the appearance of the plot (e.g. XTITLE,YTITLE,
        YSTYLE,YRANGE,/YLOG,COLOR,THICK)

 NAME:
        BPCH2ASCII

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch file v. 2.0 
        format to a simple ASCII file format
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2ASCII, INFILE, OUTFILE [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the ASCII file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2ASCII will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII format to OUTFILE.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, then BPCH2ASCII will also echo the
             header lines for each data block to the screen.

        FORMAT -> String containing the numeric format for
             for the data values.  Default is '(7(e13.6,1x))'

         GETMODELANDGRIDINFO  REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
         UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2ASCII assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same grid.  This will be true for output
            files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (2) BPCH2ASCII will write a separate ASCII file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (3) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may be either in uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) The format of the ASCII file is:

               Data block #1 header line
               Data block #1 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
               Data block #2 header line
               Data block #2 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
                ...

             The header line will contain the units and size of
             each data block.

        (5) The data is written to the ASCII file in column-major 
            order (i.e. the same way as in FORTRAN), so you can read 
            the data into FORTRAN w/ the following code:

                  READ( IUNIT, '(a)' ) HEADER
                  READ( IUNIT, '(1p,7(e13.6,1x))' )
            &       ((DATA(I,J), I=1,IMX), J=1,JMX)

            where IMX and JMX are the dimensions of the data block.       
     

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2ASCII, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii'
        
             ; Read data from binary punch file 'myfile.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII file 'myfile.bpch.ascii'.

 NAME:
        BPCH2COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in a
        COARDS-compliant netCDF (network Common Data Format) file.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2COARDS, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If INFILE
             is not passed, the user will be prompted to supply a 
             file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% (or %date%)
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2COARDS will write a separate
             netCDF file for each unique YYYYMMDD value contained
             within the *.bpch file.  If OUTFILE is not specified,
             BPCH2COARDS will use the default file name 
             "coards.%DATE%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories from the bpch file
             to save to netCDF format.  If omitted, BPCH2COARDS will 
             save all diagnostic categories.  
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the name of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.  Useful
             for debugging purposes.

        /NC4 -> Write a netCDF4 file instead of netCDF3. Default is
             NetCDF3. NetCDF4 support requires IDL 8.0 or later. 

        COMPRESS -> Integer 0-9 specifies amount of compression in
             netCDF4 files. Default is 2, with very little benefit
             for higher compression.

        /PCOORD -> Use mean pressure as the vertical coordinate rather
             sigma or eta

        /ALTCOORD -> Use mean altitude as the vertical coordinate
             rather than sigma or eta

        /TROPONLY -> Write only tropospheric layers

        /ONEFILE -> Write all data to one netCDF output file.
              Default is one file per calendar day.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2COARDS assumes that each data block in the *.bpch
            file is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2COARDS assumes that the number type of each data 
            block in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2COARDS assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2COARDS will write a separate COARDS-compliant netCDF
            file corresponding to each unique YYYYMMDD date.  This 
            prevents the files from becoming too large to be read
            with IDL.

        (5) BPCH2COARDS will replace the %DATE% (or %date%) token with
            the current YYYYMMDD value.  Therefore, it is recommended
            to insert this token into the string passed via OUTFILE.

        (6) BPCH2COARDS will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the eta or sigma centers will also be written to the
            file.  Time will be written as TAU values (i.e. hours
            since 00:00 GMT on 01-Jan-1985.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2COARDS, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more COARDS-compliant netCDF files adhering
            ; to the filename convention "myfile.YYYYMMDD.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2GMI

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.  The data
        will be shifted so that the first longitude is 0 degrees
        (i.e. the prime meridian) in order to conform with the
        GMI (Global Model Initiative) model grid definition.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
             array of names which will restrict the data block 
             selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
             within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the HDF-SD routines.

 NOTES:

            longitudes, sigma coordinates (for 3-D data blocks only!)
            to the HDF file.

        (5) BPCH2HDF will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers and sigma edges will also be written

 NAME:
        BPCH2NC

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2NC, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2N_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2N_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2N_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2NC assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2NC assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2NC assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2NC will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2NC will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  

        (7) For pure-sigma grids (e.g. GEOS-1, GEOS-STRAT, GEOS-3),
            BPCH2NC will write the following additional variables to 
            the netCDF file:

            (1) SIGE : Sigma coordinate at level edges
            (2) SIGC : Sigma coordinate at level centers

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:

                Pe(L) = Ptop + [ SIGE(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = Ptop + [ SIGC(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            %%%%% NOTE: This is mostly obsolete, as most met fields
            %%%%% that are used to drive CTM's are now placed onto
            %%%%% hybrid grids.

        (8) For hybrid grids (e.g. GEOS-4, GEOS-5, MERRA), the following
            dditional variables will be written to the netCDF file:

            (1) ETAE : Eta coordinate on level edges
            (2) ETAC : Eta coordinate on level centers
            (3) Ap   : Hybrid grid "A" parameter
            (4) Bp   : Hybrid grid "B" parameter

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:
 
                Pe(L) = Ap(L) + ( Bp(L) * Psurface )

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = ( Pe(L) + Pe(L+1) ) * 0.5

            The hybrid ETA coordinates (similar to sigma) at the 
            level edges and centers are, correspondingly:

                ETAE(L) = ( Pe(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )
                ETAC(L) = ( Pc(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )

            %%%%% NOTE: The ETAe and ETAc values are only approximate
            %%%%% and are computed with a surface pressure of 1013.25
            %%%%% hPa.  For your scientific analysis, you should compute
            %%%%% the pressures at level edges from Ap, Bp, and a 
            %%%%% spatially-varying surface pressure field (e.g. saved
            %%%%% out from GEOS-Chem or another model).
          
        (7) The date and time of the data are stored in the netCDF 
            file as global attributes.

        (8) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2NC, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2PCH

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch
        file v. 2.0 format to the ancient ASCII-punch
        file standard.
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2PCH, FILENAME [, OUTFILENAME [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the binary punch file from which 
             to read data.  FILENAME may be a file mask, and may
             contain wild card characters (e.g. ~/ctm.bpch.*). If
             FILENAME is omitted or contains a wild card character,
             the user will be prompted to pick a file via a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the output ASCII punch
             file.  Default is 'ASCIIfile.pch' 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII punch format
              to OUTFILE.

         /EXTRA_SPACE -> If set, will put an extra space between
             the numbers in the ASCII punch file.  This might 
             be necessary when using MATLAB or S-PLUS to read
             in the ASCII punch file.

 OUTPUTS:
         Writes data to ASCII punch file format

 SUBROUTINES:
         CTM_GET_DATA 

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
         Some limitations:
         (1) Works only for global lon-lat diagnostics.           
         (2) The top header line might be inaccurate (but nobody
             really reads that anyway, so forget it for now...)

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2PCH, '~/bmy/ctm.bpch', '~/bmy/ctm.pch'
        
             ; Reads data from binary punch file '~/bmy/ctm.bpch'

 NAME:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN

 PURPOSE:
        Creates monthly means from GEOS-Chem output saved at less
        than monthly intervals.  Ideal for working with output of 
        high-resolution model output, especially if your queuing
        system time limits do not permit a 1-month simulation to be
        completed in a single run stage.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FILES -> A vector containing the pathnames of the files from
             which you would like to create monthly mean output.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file (bpch format) that will
             contain the monthly mean output.  The default is 
             "bpch_monthly_mean_output.bpch".

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required
        ================================

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires other routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        Assumes that each of the files passed via the FILES argument
        contains an identical sequence of diagnostic data blocks.
        This will normally be the case for GEOS-Chem simulations that 
        have to be separated into several run stages for the queue
        system.

        Error checking is minimal, we will fix this later.  This
        routine in intended for use with files that are created from
        individual stages of a long GEOS-Chem simulation.  As such,
        we can usually assume that all files will have the same
        sequence of data blocks, and that all data blocks will be on
        the same grid.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILES = [ 'ctm.bpch.2011010100', 'ctm.bpch.2011011500' ]
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES, OUTFILENAME = 'monthly_mean.bpch'

             ; Creates monthly-mean output from two GEOS-Chem bpch
             ; files that contain 15-day averaged data.

 NAME:
        BPCH_SEP

 PURPOSE:
        Separates data from one binary punch file into another binary 
        punch file by time (TAU0), tracer, or location indices.  Useful 
        for making smaller bpch files so that we don't run out of IDL 
        memory when reading/processing them.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:p
        BPCH_SEP, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> A path name or file mask (with wildcards) 
             which indicates the names of the individual files
             to be linked together in a single bpch file.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the bpch file that will contain data
             from the individual bpch files specified by INFILES.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories for which to 
             save out to OUTFILE  Default is to save all diagnostic
             categories to OUTFILE.

        TAU0 -> Time index (hours from 1 Jan 1985) denoting the
             data blocks to be saved from INFILE to OUTFILE.  You
             can use NYMD2TAU to compute this from a YYYYMMDD date.

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which to save to OUTFILE.  
             Default is to save all tracers.

        II, JJ, LL -> Longitude, latitude, altitude index arrays used
             to cut down the data block to less than global size. Use
             IDL notation, meaning first element is 0.

        GLOBALCOORDS ->  When the data entries in the bpch file 
             contain only part of the global CTM grid (e.g. ND48,
             ND49, ND50, ND51) this indicates 
             that II, JJ, LL indices should be
             interpreted as global CTM indices, rather than relative
             to the regional subset grid. 

         EXCLUDE -> Reverses the selection criteria, so that the
         designated DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER are EXCLUDED from the
         output file. Everything else is included. In order to be
         excluded, a datablock must match all specified keywords:
         DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER. 


 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================================
        CTM_DIAGINFO    LITTLE_ENDIAN (function)
        OPEN_FILE       UNDEFINE 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Assumes that II, JJ, LL contain consecutive indices in
            longitude, latitude, and altitude, respectively.

        (2) Also assumes that II, JJ, LL are in IDL notation
            (i.e. starting from zero).  This is so that you can
            pass the output from the WHERE command to BPCH_SEP.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', tau0=140256D

             ; Pulls out data blocks for TAU0=140256 (1/1/2001) from
             ; "ctm.bpch.big" and saves them in "ctm.bpch.small"


        (2) 
        INTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        INGRID = CTM_GRID( INTYPE )
  
        INDX = WHERE( INGRID.XMID ge -60 AND INGRID.XMID le 60 )
        INDY = WHERE( INGRID.YMID ge   0 AND INGRID.YMID le 60 )
         
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', II=INDX, JJ=INDY

             ; Pulls out all data blocks for the geographical area
             ; from 60W - 60E longitude and 0-60N latitude.

 PURPOSE:
        CLOSE_DEVICE closes the PostScript device and spawns
        a print job to the printer specified by the user or
        it can be used to close a graphics window.

 CATEGORY:
        Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CLOSE_DEVICE [,OLD_DEVICE] [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        OLD_DEVICE -> Name of device that shall become the active
             plotting device. If omitted, "X", "WIN" or "MAC" will
             be set depending on !VERSION.OS_FAMILY.  Hence, 
             specification of OLD_DEVICE is only rarely needed.
             This parameter works together with the OLD_DEVICE 
             parameter of OPEN_DEVICE which returns the device name 
             before the postscript device (or a graphics device) is 
             opened.  The OLD_DEVICE parameter can be misused to set 
             the output device to anything! Therefore, it's probably 
             safest to not use it and stick with the operating system 
             dependent default.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LABEL -> a string that contains an annotation for a postscript
             plot (usually a user name and/or filename). The current 
             data and time will be appended if TIMESTAMP is set. 
             NOTE: TIMESTAMP will produce an annotation even if LABEL
             is not provided. The annotation is only added to 
             postscript plots and only if the ps file is actually 
             open.

        /TIMESTAMP  -> add date and time to the LABEL on the plot.
             If no LABEL is provided, the username and filename 
             (value of FILENAME will be used or the filename of the 
             current postscript file will be added). The timestamp 
             is only added to postscript plots and only on the last 
             page.

        PRINTER -> Name of the printer queue to send output to.
             Default is 'none', i.e. the postscript file will only 
             be closed and can then be manually printed e.g. using 
             the Unix lpr command.  Direct printing only works in 
             Unix environments.

        WINDOW -> window number to be closed (or -1 if current)

        _EXTRA=e -> any additional keywords to CLOSE_DEVICE will 
             be passed on to STRDATE which is used to format the 
             date and time string.  Possible values are: /SHORT, 
             /SORTABLE, /EUROPEAN.

        LCOLOR -> the color value for the LABEL (default 1).

        LPOSITION -> the position of the LABEL in normalized 
             coordinates (a two-element vector with default 
             [0.98,0.007]).

        LSIZE -> the charcter size of the LABEL (default 0.7).

        LALIGN -> the alignment of the LABEL (default 1).

        FILENAME -> name of the PostScript file.  This is actaully
             obsolete now because the PostScript filename is 
             determined at the time the file is opened (e.g. in
             routine OPEN_DEVICE)

 OUTPUTS:
        If postscript device is active, a *.ps file will be closed 
        and optionally sent to the printer.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================
        STRDATE (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines in the 

 NOTES: 
        The WINDOW keyword is only evaluated if the current device 
        supports windows [!D.FLAGS AND 256) GT 0]. If you only want 
        to close a postscript file and don't fuss around with your 
        screen windows then simply don't set this keyword.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        CLOSE_DEVICE

            ; Closes a postscript file (if opened) and resets the 
            ; current plotting device to 'X', 'WIN', or 'MAC' 
            ; depending on the OS_FAMILY.

        (2) 
        CLOSE_DEVICE, PRINTER='hplj4', LABEL='mgs', /TIMESTAMP

            ; If current device name is PS then the postscript 
            ; file will be closed, a user, date and time label will 
            ; be added and the file will be spooled to the printer 
            ; queue 'hplj4'. NOTE: Printing of the file fails if you 
            ; specified FILENAME as a relative path in the OPEN_DEVICE 
            ; command and you changed your working directory while
            ; the device was opened.
  
        (3)
        CLOSE_DEVICE, WIN=-1

            ; If current device name is PS then the postscript file 
            ; will be closed. If the current device is a screen 
            ; device (that supports windows), then the active window
            ;  will be deleted.

 NAME:
   CMSET_OP

 AUTHOR:
   Craig B. Markwardt, NASA/GSFC Code 662, Greenbelt, MD 20770
   craigm@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov

 PURPOSE:
   Performs an AND, OR, or XOR operation between two sets

 CATEGORY:
   Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   SET      = CMSET_OP(A, OP, B)

 DESCRIPTION:

   SET_OP performs three common operations between two sets.  The
   three supported functions of OP are:

       OP      Meaning
       'AND' - to find the intersection of A and B;
       'OR'  - to find the union of A and B;
       'XOR' - to find the those elements who are members of A or B 
               but not both;

   Sets as defined here are one dimensional arrays composed of
   numeric or string types.  Comparisons of equality between elements
   are done using the IDL EQ operator.

   The complements of either set can be taken as well, by using the
   NOT1 and NOT2 keywords.  For example, it may be desireable to find
   the elements in A but not B, or B but not A (they are different!).
   The following IDL expressions achieve each of those effects:

      SET = CMSET_OP(A, 'AND', /NOT2, B)   ; A but not B
      SET = CMSET_OP(/NOT1, A, 'AND', B)   ; B but not A

   Note the distinction between NOT1 and NOT2.  NOT1 refers to the
   first set (A) and NOT2 refers to the second (B).  Their ordered
   placement in the calling sequence is entirely optional, but the
   above ordering makes the logical meaning explicit.

   NOT1 and NOT2 can only be set for the 'AND' operator, and never
   simultaneously.  This is because the results of an operation with
   'OR' or 'XOR' and any combination of NOTs -- or with 'AND' and
   both NOTs -- formally cannot produce a defined result.

   The implementation depends on the type of operands.  For integer
   types, a fast technique using HISTOGRAM is used.  However, this
   algorithm becomes inefficient when the dynamic range in the data
   is large.  For those cases, and for other data types, a technique
   based on SORT() is used.  Thus the compute time should scale
   roughly as (A+B)*ALOG(A+B) or better, rather than (A*B) for the
   brute force approach.  For large arrays this is a significant
   benefit.

 INPUTS:

   A, B - the two sets to be operated on.  A one dimensional array of
          either numeric or string type.  A and B must be of the same
          type.  Empty sets are permitted, and are either represented
          as an undefined variable, or by setting EMPTY1 or EMPTY2.

   OP - a string, the operation to be performed.  Must be one of
        'AND', 'OR' or 'XOR' (lower or mixed case is permitted).
        Other operations will cause an error message to be produced.

 KEYWORDS

   NOT1, NOT2 - if set and OP is 'AND', then the complement of A (for
                NOT1) or B (for NOT2) will be used in the operation.
                NOT1 and NOT2 cannot be set simultaneously.

   EMPTY1, EMPTY2 - if set, then A (for EMPTY1) or B (for EMPTY2) are
                    assumed to be the empty set.  The actual values
                    passed as A or B are then ignored.

   INDEX - if set, then return a list of indices instead of the array
           values themselves.  The "slower" set operations are always
           performed in this case.

           The indices refer to the *combined* array [A,B].  To
           clarify, in the following call: I = CMSET_OP(..., /INDEX);
           returned values from 0 to NA-1 refer to A[I], and values
           from NA to NA+NB-1 refer to B[I-NA].

   COUNT - upon return, the number of elements in the result set.
           This is only important when the result set is the empty
           set, in which case COUNT is set to zero.

 RETURNS

   The resulting set as a one-dimensional array.  The set may be
   represented by either an array of data values (default), or an
   array of indices (if INDEX is set).  Duplicate elements, if any,
   are removed, and element order may not be preserved.

   The empty set is represented as a return value of -1L, and COUNT
   is set to zero.  Note that the only way to recognize the empty set
   is to examine COUNT.

 NAME:
        COLORBAR

 PURPOSE:
        Draw a colorbar (legend) with labels

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COLORBAR [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ANNOTATION -> Array with string label values.  If specified,
             ANNOTATION will override the default label values, and 
             will also override the LABEL keyword.

        BOTOUTOFRANGE, TOPOUTOFRANGE -> a color index value for data
             that falls below (or above) the normal plot range. If 
             given, an extra box will be drawn to the left (or right) 
             of the colorbar, and the colorbar will shrink in size.  
             A default label '<' (or '>') will be placed below.  
             NOTE: these options are only available for horizontal 
             colorbars.

        BOR_LABEL, TOR_LABEL -> label values for BOTOUTOFRANGE and 
             TOPOUTOFRANGE that replace the defaults.

        BOTTOM -> First color index to use.  Default is !MYCT.BOTTOM.
             NOTE: In practice you shouldn't have to specify BOTTOM,
             as the value from !MYCT.BOTTOM will reflect the settings
             of the current colortable.

        C_COLORS -> Array of color indices for "discrete" color bars
             e.g. in filled contour plots. You must also use the 
             C_LEVELS keyword, otherwise there will most likely be
             a mismatch between your plot colors and your colorbar 
             colors. COLORBAR normally limits the number of labels
             it prints to 10. Use the SKIP keyword to force a different
             behaviour. If C_COLORS is not undefined it overrides the
             settings from NCOLORS, and BOTTOM.

        C_LEVELS -> Array with label values for "discrete" colorbars.
             Use the LABEL or ANNOTATION keyword for continuous
             colorbars.  C_LEVELS must have the same number of elements 
             as C_COLORS and assigns one label to each color change 
             (LABEL distributes the labels evenly). Use the SKIP
             keyword to skip labels.  As default, COLORBAR limits the 
             number of labels printed to 10.

        AUTOSCALELEVELS -> Set this switch to automatically scale
             labels (specified by C_LEVELS, LABEL, MAX, or MIN) 
             by powers of 10. This reduces the length of each tick label
             and helps prevent overlapping numbers in the colorbar.  

        CHARSIZE -> Specifies the character size for colorbar labels.
             Default is !P.CHARSIZE.

        COLOR -> The drawing color for boxes and labels.  
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels to put on the colorbar.
             Note that this keyword is overwritten by LABEL.
             The labels will be equally spaced and the /LOG option
             will be honored.

        FLAGVAL -> If set, will place a tick mark with label at a
             user-defined value.  You can use this to denote where
             0 or 1 falls w/in a color range, for example.

        FORMAT -> Output format of the labels.  Default is determined
             according to the range given in min and max.  Label 
             strings will be trimmed, so you can safely specify 
             '(f14.2)' for example.

        LABEL -> Array containing label values (must be numeric).
             Normally, it is easier to generate labels with the 
             DIVISIONS options, but this allows tighter control 
             (e.g. 1,2,5,10,20 labels on logarithmic scales).
             Default (if no DIVISIONS are given): MIN and MAX.
             NOTE: ANNOTATION will 

        /LOG -> Set this switch to invoke logarithmic spacing of 
             labels.  The colors are *always* linearily distributed.

        MAX -> Maximum value to plot.  Default is NCOLORS.

        MIN -> Minimum value to plot.  Default is BOTTOM.

        /NOGAP -> if 0 then there is a gap b/w the triangle or
             rectangle OutOfRange boxes and the bar, else no
             gap. Defalut is to have a gap. If /TRIANGLE and no
             OutOfRange boxes are set then default is No Gap.

        NCOLORS -> Number of colors to use in the colorbar.  Default 
             is !MYCT.NCOLORS.  NOTE: In practice you shouldn't have 
             to specify NCOLORS, as the value from !MYCT.NCOLORS will 
             reflect the settings of the current colortable.

        ORIENTATION -> Specifies the orientation of the colorbar
             labels.  This keyword has the same behavior as the 
             ORIENTATION option in XYOUTS (i.e. ORIENTATION=0 means
             normal "left-right" text, ORIENTATION=-90 means "top-
             bottom" text, etc.)

        POSITION -> A position value or 4-element vector. If POSITION
             contains only one element, it will be centered at the
             bottom or right side of the page and extend over 60% of
             the total plotting area.

        SCIENTIFIC -> If set, will call STRSCI to put the colorbar
             labels in scientific notation format (e.g. in the form
             A x 10^B).  STRSCI will use the format string specified 
             in the FORMAT keyword.

        SKIP -> Print only every Nth discrete label.  The default is 
             computed such that COLORBAR will print no more than 10 
             labels.

        TITLE -> A title string for the colorbar.  (This works similarly 
             to the XTITLE or YTITLE options to the PLOT command.)

        TICKLEN -> A number between 0 and 1 which defines the length
             of the tick marks as a fraction of the size of the plot
             box.  Default is 0.25.

        /TRIANGLE -> to plot triangles at the end of the color bar. If 
             OutOfRange boxes are requested, then the triangles
             replace the rectangle.

        UNIT -> A unit string that will be added to the right of the
             labels.  If /VERTICAL is set, then the unit string will
             be placed at the top of the labels.

        UPOS -> Specifies the position (relative to the size of the 
             colorbar) where the unit string will be placed.  The
             default is 1.15.  To print the unit string closer to the
             end of the colorbar, reduce this value until the desired
             appearance is obtained.

        /VERTICAL -> Set this keyword to produce a vertical colorbar
             (default is horizontal).  Note that out-of-range boxes are
             only implemented for horizontal color bars.  

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================
        STRSCI (function)  TRIANGLE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Assumes that we are using a MYCT-defined colortable.

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine was designed after David Fanning's colorbar
            routine and adapted to our needs.  Some of the postscript
            handling of DF was removed, positioning is a little easier 
            but maybe a little less flexible; out-of-range boxes have 
            been added.

        (2) The !MYCT system variable contains the properties of the
            current MYCT-defined colortable.  You normally should not
            have to explicity pass BOTTOM or NCOLORS, as these

 PURPOSE:
        Returns the maximum number of colorbar divisions possible
        (up to a user-defined limit) such that tickmarks are placed 
        in between colors.

 CATEGORY:

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Result = COLORBAR_NDIV( NCOLORS [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        NCOLORS -> (OPTIONAL) Specifies the number of colors 
             in the color table.  Default is !MYCT.NCOLORS.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MAXDIV -> Specifies the maximum number of divisions 
             for the colorbar.  Default is 6.

 NAME:
        COMPARE_FLIGHT

 PURPOSE:
        Compare observations from aircraft campaigns to 
        high time-resolution CTM output (bpch files).
        This routine reads aircraft data in binary (bdt) format
        and produces an unlabeld plot and returns all the data
        you might ask for. If an aircraft mission extends beyond
        midnight GMT, the program will ask for a second model file
        which should be from the following day.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COMPARE_FLIGHT, keywords

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
      DATAFILE -> Name of the aircraft data file or file mask

      MODELFILE -> Name of the (first) model output file or file mask

      TRACER -> tracer number in model output (default=71)

      PSURF -> surface pressure for model grid (default=1013, because most
          aircraft data was sampled over oceans)

      FLIGHTDATA -> returns the observational data array as read
          with gte_readbin. Can also be used to pass flight data if you
          set the USE_DATA flag.

      FLIGHTVARS -> returns the variable names of the observational data.
          Must accompany FLIGHTDATA if you use USE_DATA.

      SPECIES -> the name of the observed species to plot (default CH3I).

      MODELDATA -> returns a time series of model data along the flight 
          track and a couple of min/max values:
             MODELDATA[*,0] = model value in corresponding grid box
                      [*,1] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at same level
                      [*,2] = max ...
                      [*,3] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at level below
                      [*,4] = max ...
                      [*,5] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at level above
                      [*,6] = max ...
          Note that the min/max arrays may contain values from the same
          grid boxes at the edges (i.e. there is no level below the first
          one, hence 3,4 will be identical to 1,2).

      TIME -> returns the time vector of the observations and modeldata

      /USE_DATA -> set this flag if you provide the aircraft data in the
          FLIGHTDATA array and the variable names in FLIGHTVARS. The data
          must contain variables named 'LON', 'LAT', 'ALTP' and SPECIES
          (for SPECIES see above). You must also provide a TIME vector
          which specifies UTC seconds.

 OUTPUTS:
      The extracted data is returned in MODELDATA, several other keywords
      return things read or computed in the process.

 SUBROUTINES:
      EXTRACT__FLIGHT : actual workhorse that does the extraction

 REQUIREMENTS:
      chkstru, ctm_get_data (GAMAP), gte_readbin (GTE)

 NOTES:
      Some hardwiring of default directories.

 EXAMPLE:
      simply  COMPARE_FLIGHT,tracer=1  if all you want is a plot
 
      CONVERT_FLIGHT,tracer=1,modeldata=md,time=time
      plot,time,md[*,0],color=1

 NAME:
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT

 PURPOSE:
        Compresses a diverging color table with even number of colors 
        into NCOLORS.  If the /MIDCOLORPRESENT keyword is specified,
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT will also place white or yellow spaces in
        the middle of the color table.

 CATEGORY:
	 Color


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT, R, G, B [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        R, G, B -> The vectors containing the red, blue, and 
             green color values that define the color table.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NCOLORS -> Requested number of colors to be returned.
             If NCOLORS is omitted, then COMPRESS_DIV_CT will
             return without doing anything.

        /MIDCOLORPRESENT -> Set this switch to add 1 or 2 extra
             white or yellow color spaces in the color table.  
            
        /WHITE -> If /MIDCOLORPRESENT is set, this switch will
             cause 1 (if NCOLORS is odd) or 2 (if NCOLORS is even)
             extra white color spaces to be placed
             at the center of the color table.  
            
        /YELLOW -> If /MIDCOLORPRESENT is set, this switch will
             cause 1 (if NCOLORS is odd) or 2 (if NCOLORS is even)
             extra white color spaces to be placed
             at the center of the color table.  ;

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Designed for use with MYCT.  You shouldn't normally 
        have to call COMPRESS_DIV_CT directly.

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        LOADCT, 63, FILE=FILE_WHICH( 'gamap_colors.tbl' )
        TVLCT, R, G, B, /Get

             ; Load the ColorBrewer "RdBu" table

 NAME:
        CONVERT_INDEX

 PURPOSE:
        Converts a 1-D array index (such as is returned from 
        WHERE, UNIQ, etc) to the appropriate 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D
        array indices

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CONVERT_INDEX( Index, Dim )

 INPUTS:
        INDEX -> The 1-D array index to be converted to 
             multi-dimensional indices.  INDEX is returned
             to the calling program unchanged.
 
        DIM -> A vector containing the dimensions of the array
             for which multi-dimensional indices are required.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FORTRAN -> Interpret array indices as FORTRAN indices, i.e.
             starting from 1 instead of 0. This applies to INPUT 
             and OUTPUT indices!

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Returns either a vector index or a vector of 
             multi-dimensional array indices as the value of the 
             function. If INDEX is a 1-dimensional parameter, the 
             result will have n_elements(dim) dimensions. If INDEX 
             is a multidimensional parameter, the result will be 
             a scalar.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NAME:
        CONVERT_MOLCM2_KG 

 PURPOSE:
        Converts the units of a 2-D or 3-D array from molecules/cm2 
        to kg (or, equivalently, from molecules/cm2/s to kg/s).  

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CONVERT_MOLCM2_KG, DATA, AREACM2, KGPERMOLE

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> 2-D or 3-D array of data values in units of
             molecules cm^-2 or molecules cm^-2 s^-1.

        AREACM2 -> 2-D array containing the surface area of each
             gridbox in cm^2

        KGPERMOLE -> The molecular weight of the tracer or
             molecule, in units of kg/mole.
 
 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> The converted array in kg/s is returned in DATA. 
             DATA is returned with the same dimensions as
             it had when it was passed to CONVERT_MOLCM2_KG.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        CTM_SURFACE_AREA must be called to compute the AREACM2 array.
        TRACER_KG_PER_MOLE (or a similar subroutine) must be called
        to compute the KGPERMOLE array.
             
 NOTES:

 EXAMPLE:
        AreaCm2      = CTM_SURFACE_AREA( GridInfo, /cm2, /GEOS )
        KgPerMole    = TRACER_KG_PER_MOLE( /FULLCHEM )
        TracerNumber = 1   ; for NOx
        CONVERT_MOLCM2_KG, Data, AreaCm2, KgPerMole

            Will convert the Data array for the GEOS-1 model (using
            the molecular weight for NOx) from molecules/cm2/s to kg/s.

 NAME:
        CONVERT_UNIT

 PURPOSE:
        Convert data to a different unit. You can either 
        replace a unit by the corresponding standard SI unit or 
        replace a specific unit with another one.

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CONVERT_UNIT,DATA,UNIT,TOPARAM [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> A data vector, array, or a single value that shall
            be converted to a new unit. 

        UNIT -> A string variable containing the (current) unit of 
            DATA. This will be replaced by the new unit afterwards.
            If omitted, you must give the FROM_UNIT keyword to indicate
            the current unit of DATA.

        TOPARAM -> The unit to convert DATA to. This is equivalent to 
            the keyword TO_UNIT and overwrites it.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FROM_UNIT -> An individual unit to search and replace. If not
            given, any unit will be converted to TO_UNIT, as long as
            the current unit belongs to the same category. 

        TO_UNIT -> An individual unit to convert to. If not given, all
            unit that are converted (see FROM_UNIT) will be replaced
            by the standard SI unit of their category.

        For the individual unit and categories see FIND_UNIT 

        RESULT -> returns 1 if conversion was successful, 0 otherwise
            This keyword is mostly for consistency witholder routines.
            It is more convenient to test !ERROR_STATE.CODE for being
            0.

        MINVAL -> minimum valid data value. Only data above this 
            value will be converted (default: -1.E30)

        QUIET -> In case of an error, an error message is displayed,
            and the !ERROR_STATUS system variable is set to reflect the
            error condition (program execution continues). Set the
            QUIET keyword to suppress the error message.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA will be converted and unit will contain new names.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses FIND_UNIT

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        CONVERT_UNIT wil return the value and unit unchanged if
        the unit was not found in the standard list (see FIND_UNIT)
        or the category of the target unit does not match the
        category of the source unit. In these cases, !ERROR_STATE.CODE
        will be set to signal an error condition.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; create some data
        data = findgen(100)
        unit = 'cm'

        ; convert all data to SI unit of same category (m)
        convert_unit,data,unit

        ; test success
        if (!ERROR_STATE.CODE ne 0) then stop

        ; convert temperature in Fahrenheit to 'deg C'
        ; (multiple calls to capture all different spellings)
        ; Data will only be changed if unit is indeed Fahrenheit
        convert_unit,data,unit,from='F',to='deg C'
        convert_unit,data,unit,from='degF',to='deg C'
        convert_unit,data,unit,from='deg F',to='deg C'

        ; (easier way) convert any temperature to 'C'
        ; This will also convert 'K' !
        ; Don't display error message
        convert_unit,data,unit,to='C',/QUIET

        ; convert 'mph' data to SI ('m/s')
        convert_unit,data,unit,from='mph'

        ; explicitely convert 'cm' to 'm'
        convert_unit,data,'cm','m'
        ; equivalent to
        convert_unit,data,from='cm',to='m'

 NAME:
        CREATE_NESTED_ASCII

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from an ASCII file and trims it to nested-grid
        resolution.  Also renumbers I and J from "global" to "window" 
        coordinates.  Vertical and temporal resolution are not affected.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CREATE_NESTED_ASCII [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        INMODELNAME -> A string containing the name of the model 
             grid on which the input data resides.  Default is 'GEOS3'.

        INRESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             on which the input data resides.  INRESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default is 1.

        INFILENAME -> Name of the input file containing data to be 
             trimmed down to "nested" model grid resolution.  If 
             omitted, a dialog box will prompt the user to supply
             a filename.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain trimmed
             data on the "nested" model grid.  OUTFILENAME will be
             in binary punch resolution.  If omitted, a dialog box 
             will prompt the user to supply a filename.

        XRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center longitudes which define the nested
             model grid. Default is [-180,180].

        YRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center latitudes which define the nested
             model grid. Default is [-180,180].

        HEADER -> Number of header lines to skip over.

        FORMAT -> String describing the input file format.  
             Default is '(2i3,a)', i.e., two 3-digit integers
             and then an unspecified length character line.

 CATEGORY
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Models & Grids

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        result = CTM_BOXSIZE( GRIDINFO [,RADIUS [,KEYWORDS] ] ) 

 INPUTS:
        GRIDINFO -> the structure returned by function CTM_GRID,
             which contains the following necessary fields:
	      IMX   (int   ) -> Maximum I (longitude) dimension 
             JMX   (int   ) -> Maximum J (latitude ) dimension
             YMID  (fltarr) -> Array of latitude  centers

        RADIUS -> The radius of the earth in km.  This may be 
             passed as an input parameter, or can be specified via 
             the GEOS_RADIUS, GISS_RADIUS, or FSU_RADIUS keywords.
             As default, the GEOS value of 6375.0 km is used.

 OUTPUT:
        CTM_BOXSIZE returns a 2-D (or 1D) array of CTM surface areas,
        or a 3-D array for CTM grid box volumes.  The default unit 
        is square kilometers or cubic kilometers.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /CM2 -> Return ctm surface areas in square centimeters.
             [default: km^2].  

        /M2 -> Return ctm_surface areas in square meters.
             [default: km^2].  

        /CM3 -> Return grid box volumes in cubic centimeters.

        /VOLUME -> Will cause CTM_BOXSIZE to return grid box volumes 
             instead of grid box surface areas.
       
        GEOS_RADIUS -> selects GEOS value for earth radius (6375.0 km) 
             [default]

        GISS_RADIUS -> selects GISS value for earth radius (6371.4 km)

        FSU_RADIUS -> selects FSU value for earth radius (6371.4 km)
      
        IJ, IL, JL -> determine which area shall be computed [default: IJ]
             NOTE: IL computes area of southern boundary

        XLEN, YLEN, ZLEN -> Returns length of linear segments 
             (lat, lon, alt) to calling program.  If /CM2 or /CM3 is 
             specified, then XLEN, YLEN, ZLEN will be in centimeters.
             If /M2 or /M3 are specified, then XLEN, YLEN, ZLEN will
             be in meters. (Default unit is km).

        NO_2D -> return 1D vector instead of 2D array

        LATIND -> for IL and JL: return result for given latitude index
             [default is equator]. This implies NO_2D. The index must
             be provided as FORTRAN index (e.g. 1..72).

 NAME:
        CTM_CLEANUP

 PURPOSE: 
        Free memory blocked by excessive use of the GAMAP package.
        With the /DATA_ONLY option, only the data blocks themselves
        are freed, all header information remains accessible. 
        This speeds up any further analysis.  Also calls HEAP_GC
        to do garbage collection on unused heap variables.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_CLEANUP [, /DATA_ONLY, /NO_GC, /NO_FILE_CLOSE ]

 INPUTS:
        none

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DATA_ONLY -> Only free heap variables that point to the
             actual data records. Leave all 'info' intact. Default 
             is to remove everything includign the global DATAINFO 
             and FILEINFO structure arrays.  NOTE: Setting this switch

 NAME:
        CTM_COLUMN_DU

 PURPOSE:
        Calculates columns in Dobson Units for a given tracer.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_COLUMN_DU( DiagN, [ Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> Diagnostic category name (or number) containing the
             tracer data for which columns will be computed.  The
             default is 'IJ-AVG-$' (i.e. v/v mixing ratios).
             
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> (OPTIONAL) File containing CTM data for which 
             to compute columns.  If omitted, then the user will
             be prompted to select a file via a dialog box.

        TAU0 -> Starting TAU value of the desired data block (will
             be passed to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK).  If omitted, then 
             CTM_COLUMN_DU will read data for the first time in
             the data file.

        TRACER -> Number of tracer for which to compute columns.

        PFILENAME -> Name of the file containing surface pressure
             data (this is necessary in order to compute column
             sums).  If PFILENAME is omitted, then CTM_COLUMN_DU
             will look for surface pressure data in FILENAME.

        PTAU0 -> TAU0 value by which surface pressure data in
             PFILENAME is indexed.  If PTAU0 is omitted, then
             CTM_COLUMN_DU will use TAU0.  

        PTRACER -> Tracer number for the surface pressure data.
             Default is 1.  (For some GISS-CTM punch files, surface
             pressure is saved as tracer #0). 

        TROPFILENAME -> Name of the file containing the annual mean
             tropopause data for the GEOS-Chem model.  If TROPFILENAME
             is supplied, then columns will be computed from the
             surface up to the annual mean tropopause height.
             Otherwise, columns will be computed for the full
             vertical extent of the data.

        /DOUBLE -> If set, will return column sums as double
             precision.  Otherwise, will return column sums as
             single precision.

        MODELINFO -> Returns to the calling program the MODELINFO
             structure (i.e. output from CTM_TYPE) corresponding to 
             the data.

        GRIDINFO -> Returns to the calling program the GRIDINFO 
             structure (i.e. output from CTM_GRID) corresponding
             to the data.

        XMID -> Returns to the calling program the longitude centers
             in degrees for the extracted data block.
 
        YMID -> Returns to the calling program the latitude centers
             in degrees for the extracted data block.

        ZMID -> Returns to the calling program the altitude centers
             in # of levels for the extracted data block.
       
        /DU -> If set, will return column sums in Dobsun units.
	      Otherwise, will return column sums in molec/cm2. (jaf, 8/19/08)

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords.


 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> a 2-D array containing the columns for TRACER
             in Dobson Units (DU).  1 DU = 2.69e16 molec/cm2.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:

        EXTRACT_FILENAME (function) 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines in both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) An internal consistency check is now done to make sure
            the tracer data block is of the same model and resolution
            as the surface pressure and annual mean tropopause data blocks.

 EXAMPLE:
        Result = CTM_COLUMN_DU( 'IJ-AVG-$',          $
                                FileName='ctm.bpch'  $
                                Tracer=20,           $
                                Tau0=80304.0,        $
				 /DU )

             ; Returns O3 columns in DU from the file "ctm.bpch", 
             ; for March 1994 (TAU0 = 80304 for GEOS date 3/1/1994).

        Return information about available categories, tracers or 
        time steps in either a given or the global datainfo structure 
        array.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_DATAINFO( [DIAGN] [,DATAINFO] [,keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name for which
             information shall be returned on available tracers 
             or time steps. If not given, CTM_DATAINFO returns
             information about all available diagnostics instead.
 
        DATAINFO -> An optional subset of the global DataInfo 
             structure array. If given, the search will be 
             restricted to the data records contained in DATAINFO.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /TRACER -> If set, CTM_DATAINFO returns all tracer numbers
             that are available with the given diagnostics. This
             keyword has no effect if no DIAGN is given.

        /TAU0 -> Returns information about all available time steps
             for a given diagnostics. This keyword has no effect if
             either DIAGN is not given or /TRACER is set.
    
        /TAU1 -> Same as TAU0, but for the end of the time step.

        If none of these keywords is set, CTM_DATAINFO returns the
        index values for the DATAINFO structure array that match
        the requested diagnostics.

        STATUS -> restrict search to: 0=unread data, 1=read data.
             Default is 2=no restriction

        /EXPAND -> For multilevel diagnostics, CTM_DATAINFO normally
             returns only the template (with the '$' character). Use
             this keyword to get all individual levels as well.

 OUTPUTS:
        Depending on the keywords and the DIAGN parameter, an array
        with diagmostics numbers, index values, tracer numbers, or 
        time steps is returned. 

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_DIAGINFO, DIAGN, DIAGSTRU [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> Diagnostic category name for which to extract the 
             information.  To retrieve information about all CTM
             diagnostic categories use the /ALL_DIAGS keyword.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /ALL_DIAGS -> Retrieves information about all diagnostics.

        CATEGORY -> Returns to the calling program the punch
             file category name of the requested diagnostic(s)

        FILENAME -> Name of the diaginfo file (default diaginfo.dat)
             The file will be searched in the current directory first, 
             then in the directory where CTM_DIAGINFO.PRO is located.
             If not found in either location, a standard data block is
             retrieved from this file.

        /FORCE_READING -> Read from the diaginfo file (specified in
             FILENAME) and overwrite the contents of the common block.

        MAXTRACER -> Returns to the calling program the maximum
             number of tracers stored in the requested diagnostic(s).
             NOTE: This is now only necessary for backwards 
             compatibility with the GISS-II ASCII punch files.

        OFFSET -> Returns to the calling program the offset constant 
             that is used to locate tracers in the "tracerinfo.dat"
             file.  OFFSET is needed to locate the proper index from
             the "tracerinfo.dat" file.

        SPACING -> Returns to the calling program the interval
             between diagnostic offsets.

 OUTPUTS:
        DIAGSTRU -> returns a structure or structure array with the 
             following tags:
             Category  : Category name for this diagnostic
             Offset    : Offset factor used in "tracerinfo.dat" file

        Requires routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        (1) At first call, the tracer information structure array is
        read from a file.  Thereafter, the information is stored in a 
        common block where it is accessible in subsequent calls.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        CTM_DIAGINFO, 'BIOGSRCE', R
        PRINT, R.CATEGORY, ':', R.MAXTRACER, ':',R.OFFSET

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 19 May 1998: VERSION 1.00
                          - developed from CTM_TRACERINFO.PRO v. 2.0 by
                            Martin Schultz (08 May 1998)
                            see comments to CTM_TRACERINFO.PRO for 
                            modification history of that subroutine
        bmy, 20 May 1998: - removed SCALE and UNIT structure tags & keywords
                          - added OFFSET structure tag & keyword
        bmy, 27 May 1998: - changed "tracers" to "diagnostics" in 
                            print statement.
        mgs, 13 Aug 1998: - now returns only first diagnostics for a
                            given number.  This permits to keep old
                            and new diagnostics in one file and use
                            the old diagnostics by name.
                          - introduced extra search one level above 
                            current dir.
        mgs, 17 Aug 1998: - changed defaults vor void return
                          - diaginfo.dat: MAXTRACER meaning changed!
        bmy, 17 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                          - Removed INDEX and TYPE, they're obsolete
                          - Now use new file format for "diaginfo.dat"

 NAME:
        CTM_DIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Computes absolute or relative differences between two CTM
        data blocks, and creates a new entry in the global DATAINFO
        structure.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_DIFF, DIAGN, [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name (see
             (CTM_DIAGINFO). A value of 0 (or an empty string)
             prompts processing of all available diagnostics.
             DIAGN can also be an array of diagnostic numbers or
             category names.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILE -> File name or list of file names containing the data 
             blocks to be differenced.  

        ILUN -> Logical unit number, or list of logical unit numbers
             of the files that contain the data blocks to be differenced.   

        TAU0 -> A time value or list of values to restrict the search.
             Default handling as with ILUN or TRACER. TAU0 superseeds
             /FIRST, /LAST or TAURANGE.

        TRACER -> Tracer ID number, or list of tracer ID numbers.  
             CTM_DIFF will difference the data blocks for diagnostic 
             DIAGN and tracer TRACER.

        /PERCENT -> If set, will compute the percent difference
             between two data blocks as 100 * ( DATA2 - DATA1 ) / DATA1.  
             Default is to compute the absolute difference DATA2 - DATA1.  

        NEWTRACER -> Returns to the calling program the tracer values
             for the data blocks, as read in from disk.

        NEWTAU -> Returns to the calling program the TAU0 values for
             the data blocks, as read in from disk.

        RANGE -> Returns the min & max difference values to the
             calling program.

        /MASK -> If set, the absolute % difference is return, with
             data below either thresholds (see pc_thr and diff_thr)
             set to a negative value, -99 .They are "masked", and can
             be set to a specific color in a plot (see ctm_plotdiff
             usage of the same keyword) or set to NaN for future
             analysis.
             
	 PC_THR, DIFF_THR : the %-Diff and Diff THResholds to mask data if
             /MASK is set.  Default values are 1% and 1e4.

 OUTPUTS:
        CTM_DIFF will append an entry to the global DATAINFO array of
        structures pertaining to the difference between the data
        blocks.

 OUTPUT KEYWORD:
 
        OUTLUN -> set this keyword to a variable name that will hold
             the LUN associated with the newly computed difference
             data.

        SUCCESS -> 0 by default, becomes 1 if MASK is set and all
             data are below the thresholds that define the MASK.


 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Requrired:
        =========================================================
        CTM_GET_DATA             CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO (function)
        CTM_GRID     (function)  GAMAP_CMN         (include file)
        INV_INDEX    (function)  YESNO             (function)
        CTM_DIAGINFO 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

        Also, currently will only look at data blocks with the same
        tracer, since differencing two different tracers is not
        always that productive. 

 NOTES:
        (1) If DATA1 corresponds to the "old" data, and DATA2
            corresponds to the "new" data, then CTM_DIFF will 
            compute the following:
         
            Abs. Diff = ( new - old )
            % Diff    = ( new - old ) / old

        (2) The DATAINFO entries created by CTM_DIFF can be read into
            GAMAP with the /NOFILE option.  The ILUN values of these 
            data blocks will be negative, indicating derived data.

        (3) The call to CTM_REGRID probably does not work yet.
             Will get around to fixing that later...

 EXAMPLE:
        (1) Call CTM_DIFF to compute an absolute difference between
            two data blocks from two different punch files, at the
            same TAU0 value, for OH (DIAGN='CHEM-L=$', TRACER=1).
            
            FILE = [ 'ctm.bpch.v4-30', 'ctm.bpch.v4-31' ] 
            CTM_DIFF, 'CHEM-L=$', FILE=FILE, TRACER=1


        (2) Call CTM_DIFF to compute a relative difference between
            two data blocks from the same punch file, at two
            different TAU0 values, for tracer 1 (Radon).

            ILUN = 20
            TAU0 = [ 74472L, 74640L ]

            CTM_DIFF, 'IJ-AVG-$', ILUN=ILUN, TAU0=TAU0, $
                  TRACER=1, /Percent

 NAME:
        CTM_DOSELECT_DATA (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Return indices for data blocks that match specific
        criteria.  This is an internal routine which is called
        by CTM_GET_DATA.  

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        INDEX = CTM_DOSELECT_DATA( DIAGN, USE_DATAINFO [, keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        CATEGORY -> A string or string array with category names
            to search for. Multilevel categories can be expanded to
            a string array with the EXPAND_CATEGORY function.
            Usually, CTM_DOSELECT_DATA should be called with only
            one "logical" category at the time, i.e. only for
            multilevel diagnostics should it contain more than one
            element. Otherwise, the tracer offset may be wrong.

        USE_DATAINFO -> A valid DataInfo structure. No error checking 
            is performed.

        Both parameters are mandatory.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ILUN -> A logical unit value or an array of logical unit
            values. Only records from corresponding files will be 
            returned. If ILUN is an undefined variable, information
            about all previously opened files will be returned,
            and ILUN will contain all logical unit numbers that 
            match the selection criteria.

        TRACER -> A tracer number or an array of tracer numbers to
            restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all tracers.
            Tracer numbers less than 100 are automatically expanded
            to include the offset of certain diagnostics (see
            keyword TRCOFFSET and routine CTM_DIAGINFO). If TRACER is
            an undefined variable, all tracers that match the selection 
            criteria are returned.

        TRCOFFSET -> A tracer offset (multiple of 100) that will be
            added to TRACER. The search is performed for both,
            TRACER and TRACER+TRCOFFSET. (for tracer offsets see
            routine CTM_DIAGINFO and file diaginfo.dat)
 
        TAU -> A time value (tau0 !) or an array of time values
            to restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all time steps. If TAU is an
            undefined variable, it will return all time steps that
            match the selection criteria.

        STATUS -> Restricts the data selection to
            Data that has not been read  (STATUS = 0)
            Data that has been read      (STATUS = 1)
            All data blocks              (STATUS = 2, default)
            If STATUS is 1, all pointers returned in DATA are tested
            for validity. Status will automatically be restricted 
            to range 0..1

        COUNT -> A named variable that will return the number of
            data blocks found with the given selection criteria

        MISSING -> If no records were found that match the selection 
            criteria, MISSING will return a string array with the 
            items that could not be matched (e.g. ['TRACER','ILUN']).
            If records were found, MISSING returns an empty string.

        SPACING -> Passes to CTM_DOSELECT_DATA the spacing between
            diagnostic offsets listed in "diaginfo.dat".  

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns an (long) integer array that contains
        index values to all the data blocks that match the selection
        criteria. If no data is found, -1L is returned.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses IS_SELECTED function

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        See CTM_SELECT_DATA and CTM_READ_DATA source codes.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

        mgs, 07 Oct 1998: - added DEBUG keyword
        mgs, 22 Oct 1998: - now filters ilun, tracer, and tau
                            after finding matching records. This
                            was necessary to find the correct first
                            or last time step in CTM_GET_DATA.
                            Needs some more testing whether there are
                            side effects when TAU0 and ILUN or TRACER
                            are specified.

 NAME:
        CTM_EXTRACT (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Extracts a block of data from a 3-D CTM data cube.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_EXTRACT, DATA, MODELINFO, GRIDINFO [,Keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> The data cube from which to extract a region.
             DATA must be 3-dimensional (e.g. lon-lat-alt, or 
             lon-lat-tracer, etc).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MODELINFO -> The MODELINFO structure returned from function 
             CTM_TYPE.  

        GRIDINFO -> The GRIDINFO structure returned from function
             CTM_GRID.

        AVERAGE -> Bit flag indicating the dimensions over which to
             average the data:
                1 :  longitudinal
                2 :  latitudinal
                4 :  vertical
             These values can be combined. E.g., to average over 
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE 
             superseeds the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see below).
 
        TOTAL -> Bit flag indicating the dimensions over which
             to sum the data:
                1 :  longitudinal
                2 :  latitudinal
                4 :  vertical
             These values can be combined. E.g., to integrate over
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE
             superseeds the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see above).

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as index 
             arrays.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as 
             ranges (i.e. two-element vectors containing min and max values).

        LAT -> An index array of latitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max latitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -90, 90 ].

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max sigma levels to be included
             in the extracted data block.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].

        LON -> An index array of longitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max longitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -180, 180 ].

        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude 
             values (or a scalar specifying a single altitude) to
             be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure levels 
             (or a scalar specifying a single pressure level) to be
             included in the extracted data block.

        WE -> Returns to the calling program the index array of longitudes 
             for the extracted data region, ordered from west to east.

        SN -> Returns to the calling program the index array of latitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from South to North.
 
        UP -> Returns to the calling program the index array of vertical  
             levels for the extracted data region, ordered from surface
             to top.

        DIM -> A named variable will return the new dimension information 
             of the data block after averaging or totaling.

        _EXTRA=e   -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_INDEX.

 OUTPUTS:
        X, Y, Z -> Arrays of latitude, longitude, or altitude values 
             corresponding to the the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dimensions of 
             the DATA array, respectively.

 SUBROUTINES:
        CTM_INDEX 
        DEFAULT_RANGE (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses GAMAP package subroutines.

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_EXTRACT returns the extracted data region as 
        the function value.

        (2) Assumes a 3-D data cube as input, of dimensions (lon, lat,
        alt), or for some diagnostics (lon, lat, "tracer" number).

        (3) In the calling program, CTM_TYPE and CTM_GRID must be 
        called to compute the MODELINFO and GRIDINFO structures,
        which can then be passed to CTM_EXTRACT.

        (4) If any of the LAT, LON, LEV, ALTRANGE, PRANGE keywords are
        explicity specified, then CTM_EXTRACT will return to the
        calling program their original, unmodified values.  If any
        of these are not explicitly specified , then CTM_EXTRACT 
        will return to the calling program default values.  

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        MODELINFO  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        GRIDINFO   = CTM_GRID( MODELINFO )
        DATAREGION = CTM_EXTRACT( DATACUBE,                   $
                                  MODELINFO=MODELINFO,        $
                                  GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO           $
                                  LON=[-180,0], LAT=[-30,30], $ 
                                  LEV=[1,10] )

               ; Extracts from a GEOS-4 4x5 data cube a region 
               ; delimited by longitude = [-180, 0], 
               ; latitude = [-30, 30], for levels 1 to 10.

        (2)
        LON = INDGEN( 36 )
        LAT = INDGEN( 16 ) + 15
        LEV = INDGEN( 10 ) 
        MODELINFO  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4' )
        GRIDINFO   = CTM_GRID( MODELINFO )
        DATAREGION = CTM_EXTRACT( DATACUBE,            $
                                  MODELINFO=MODELINFO, $
                                  GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO,   $
                                  /INDEX,  LON=LON,    $
                                  LAT=LAT, LEV=LEV )

               ; Extracts same data region as in Example (1) but 
               ; here passes explicit index arrays instead of ranges.

 NAME:
        CTM_GETWEIGHT

 PURPOSE:
        Computes the "mapping weights" for regridding data from
        a "fine" CTM grid to a CTM grid of equal or coarser 
        horizontal resolution.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_GETWEIGHT, OLDGRID, NEWGRID, WEIGHT, XX_IND, YY_IND [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        OLDGRID -> GRIDINFO structure (use ctm_grid to create one) 
             which defines the old ("fine") grid.

        NEWGRID -> GRIDINFO structure (use ctm_grid to create one) 
             which defines the new ("coarse") grid.
 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        WEIGHTFILE (optional) -> Name of the file to which WEIGHT,
             XX_IND, and YY_IND will be written.  If WEIGHTFILE is
             not given, then

        WEIGHTFORMAT (optional) -> Specify the format string used to
             save the mapping weights to WEIGHTFILE.  For high-res grids,
             you may need to specify more than the default 2 decimal 
             precision.  Default value is '(3x,12f6.2)'.

 OUTPUTS:
        WEIGHT -> Array of mapping weights which defines the fraction
             of each "fine" grid box that fits into each "coarse" 
             grid box.

        XX_IND -> Array of "longitude" grid box indices of the "fine" 
             grid boxes that fit into each "coarse" grid box.  

        YY_IND -> Array of "latitude" grid box indices of the "fine" 
             grid boxes that fit into each "coarse" grid box.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine was adapted from CTM_REGRID.  It is
            sometimes computationally expedient to compute the
            mapping weights once for the entire horizontal grid 
            and save them to a file for future use.
            
        (2) Right now this only works in regridding from a "fine" 
            grid to a grid of equal horiziontal resolution (i.e. with
            shifted grid boxes) or coarser horizontal resolution.

 EXAMPLE:
        OLDTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GENERIC', RES=1, HALFPOLAR=0, CENTER180=0 )
        OLDGRID = CTM_GRID( OLDTYPE, /NO_VERTICAL )
        NEWTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        NEWGRID = CTM_GRID( NEWTYPE, /NO_VERTICAL )

        CTM_GETWEIGHT, OLDGRID, NEWGRID, WEIGHT, XX_IND, YY_IND, $
             WEIGHTFILE = 'weights.1x1.to.geos1.4x5']

             ; Precomputes the mapping weights for regridding a
             ; 1 x 1 grid to the GEOS-1 4 x 5 grid, and saves them
             ; to an ASCII file named "weights.1x1.to.geos1.4x5"

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 11 Aug 2000: VERSION 1.01
                          - adapted from CTM_REGRID
        bmy, 21 Jan 2003: VERSION 1.02
                          - Added fix for GEOS 1 x 1.25 grid

                          - Added fix for GENERIC 2.5 x 2.5 grid
        bmy, 29 Jun 2006: - Added fix for GEOS 1x1 -> GENERIC 1x1 
  bmy & phs, 04 Oct 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - added fix for GENERIC 0.5 x 0.5 grid
                          - general fix for over-the-dateline cases
        bmy, 26 Sep 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Add WEIGHTFORMAT keyword to specify more
                            decimal places of precision if need be

 NAME:
        CTM_GET_DATA

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve specific data records from CTM output files.
        Opening files, parsing header information, and loading
        of data are handled transparently and can be 
        controlled by various keywords. The routine returns a
        subset of the global DATAINFO structure that matches the
        requested category and (optional) tracer and time step(s).

        This routine should be called *whenever* you want to 
        access data and you are not sure that it has been 
        loaded previously. It provides the general user-interface
        for GAMAP (the Global Atmospheric Model output Analysis 
        Package). 

        For the future, a widget interface to this routine is 
        planned.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_GET_DATA, DATAINFO [,DIAGN] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name (see
             (CTM_DIAGINFO). A value of 0 (or an empty string)
             prompts processing of all available diagnostics.
             DIAGN can also be an array of diagnostic numbers or
             category names.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> (optional) If FILENAME is a fully qualified file path
             the specified file is opened without user interaction.
             If filename is empty or contains wildchards (*,?), a
             pickfile dialog will be displayed.
             If FILENAME is a named variable it will contain the full
             file path upon return so that a subsequent call to
             CTM_GET_DATA with the same FILENAME argument will not prompt
             another file selection dialog.
                If the FILENAME keyword is present, CTM_GET_DATA
             will restrict it's scope to records from the selected
             is file (even if FILENAME contains an empty string, it will 
             restrict the scope of the search!).
                If the file is found in the global FILEINFO structure or
             the USE_FILEINFO structure (i.e. it has been opened 
             previously), then it will not be parsed again; instead the
             data records are returned from memory.
                The data itself is loaded transparently via 
             CTM_RETRIEVE_DATA.

        ILUN -> An optional value or array of logical unit numbers. If
             given, the search is restricted to data from the specified
             files. Default is to use all files (unless the FILENAME
             keyword is present). If an undefined variable
             is passed into ILUN, information about all accessible files
             in the global FILEINFO structure (or USE_FILEINFO) is returned.

        TRACER -> A tracer ID number or a list of those. If given, the
             search is restricted to those tracers. Default is to use all 
             tracers. If an undefined variable is passed into TRACER, 
             and one specific diagnostics is requested with DIAGN,
             information about all accessible tracers in the global
             DATAINFO structure or USE_DATAINFO structure or the
             DATAINFO structure associated with a specific file is returned.

        TAU0 -> A time value or list of values to restrict the search.
             Default handling as with ILUN or TRACER. TAU0 superseeds
             /FIRST, /LAST or TAURANGE.

        TAURANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the first and last tau0
             value to look for. 

        /FIRST, /LAST -> extract first or last time step that is stored for
             the selected diagnostics, ilun, and tracer. Only one can be 
             be active at a time. /LAST superseeds /FIRST.

        INDEX -> A named variable that will contain the indices of the 
             records in USE_DATAINFO that match the selection criteria.
             You can test INDEX[0] ge 0 in order to see if CTM_GET_DATA has
             been successful although it is now recommended to test for
             n_elements(DATAINFO) eq 0. 
                The INDEX keyword is useful if you want to change the
             information contained in the selected DATAINFO structures
             globally.

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATA will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO must contain entries for all logical unit numbers
             that are used in USE_DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

        /INTERNAL_USE -> Set this keyword if you want to prevent a call
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE, but instead abort in case of undefined 
             (global) FILEINFO or DATAINFO structures.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> An array of DATAINFO records that match the selected 
             criteria. You can then simply loop over 
             0..n_elements(DATAINFO)-1 to access all data records and 
             extract the data as *(DATAINFO[i].data).
             DATAINFO will be undefined if no records are found!!
             Always test for  IF (n_elements(DATAINFO) eq 0) ... !
             NOTE: Alternatively you can return the INDEX to the selected
             data records in the global (or USE_) datainfo structure array
             with the INDEX keyword. This may in some cases eliminate the
             need to make a local copy of the selected DATAINFO records. 

 SUBROUTINES:
       pro reopen_all_files,fileinfo
       (needed in order to get free unit numbers)

       pro make_compound_datainfo,DataInfo,category,ilun,tracer,tau0,tau1
       (make compound structure for multilevel or multitracer diagnostics)

       pro update_tracer_datainfo,datainfo,traceroffset
       (enter tracer information into global datainfo structure)

 REQUIREMENTS:
       Several ctm_* routines are used
       Also uses UNDEFINE (by D. Fanning)

 NOTES:
       Please test rigorously. In case of read errors, try using CTM_OPEN_FILE
       with the /PRINT keyword.

       If your model output (ASCII punch file) does not contain the
       dimensional information about each data block, it may cause problems
       for diagnostics that do not contain 72x46 elements.
       It's defintively a good idea to implement this little change *NOW* !

       Outline of this procedure:
       - get all data records that match selection criteria
       - create "compound" datainfo structures for multilevel and
         multitracer diagnostics (those hold 3D data blocks)
       - read data for all selected compound structures unless only
         status information requested

        mgs, 19 Nov 1998: - bug fix with scale factor. Didn't get globally
                            updated because it was linked to unit. Need a
                            more generic global update procedure !
        mgs, 03 Dec 1998: - yet another bug fix in reopen files: needed

                          - Now reference function LITTLE_ENDIAN
                          - Swap endian in OPEN_FILE if reading data
                            on a little-endian machine (e.g. PC) 
        bmy, 19 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                          - now test valid diagnostics using 
                            DIAGSTRU[*].CATEGORY and not DIAGSTRU[*].INDEX
                          - removed /SMALLCHEM keyword, it's obsolete
                          - Now recognizes binary files as having
                            FILETYPE values between 100 and 200

                          - Internal routine MAKE_COMPOUND_DATAINFO
                            now passes SPACING from CTM_DIAGINFO
                            to routine CTM_DOSELECT_DATA
        bmy, 27 Oct 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - added QUIET keyword to suppress printing
                            information about retrieved tracers
        bmy, 06 Feb 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - Bug fix: use DIALOG_PICKFILE to get file name
                            before calling CTM_OPEN_FILE.  This is necessary
                            because the tests for certain file types requires
                            the file name to be known ahead of time.
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10

                            CTM_OPEN_FILE. This allows to read nested 
                            met (GMAO) files by using /NA or /CHINA
  bmy & phs, 20 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                          - If FILENAME is not defined, then the value
                            of the filename selected via dialog box
                            will be passed back to the calling program.

 KNOWN BUGS OR WEAKNESSES:
        - handling of USE_DATAINFO and USE_FILEINFO is not carried 
          through all lower level subroutines, i.e. they may be replaced
          by *pGlobal... in some occasions. Since USE_... should always
          be a subset of *pGlobal..., no serious errors are expected
          from this weakness. 

        - known bug in update_tracer_datainfo, see comment in routine.

 NAME:
        CTM_GET_DATABLOCK

 PURPOSE:
        Extracts a data block from a CTM punch file.
        (Wrapper program for CTM_GET_DATA and CTM_EXTRACT.)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        SUCCESS = CTM_GET_DATABLOCK(DATA [,DIAGN] [,Keywords])

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name (see
             (CTM_DIAGINFO). This must uniquely identify a
             specific data type.  DIAGN is passed to CTM_GET_DATA


 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
     Keywords that are passed to CTM_GET_DATA:
     =========================================
        FILENAME   -> Name of the file to open.  FILENAME is passed
                      to CTM_GET_DATA.  CTM_GET_DATA will return
                      the full path name, which is then returned
                      to the calling program.

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATA will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO and USE_DATAINFO must be consistent, and should
             either both be used or omitted. However, it is
             possible to provide the global FILEINFO structure 
             (or nothing) with a local subset of DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

     Keywords that are passed to CTM_EXTRACT:
     ========================================
        AVERAGE -> Bit flag to average over certain dimensions
             (see CTM_EXTRACT)

        TOTAL -> Bit flag to sum over certain dimensions 
             (see CTM_EXTRACT)

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as index 
             arrays.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as 
             ranges (i.e. two-element vectors containing min and max values).

        LAT -> An index array of latitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max latitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -90, 90 ].

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max sigma levels to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].

        LON -> An index array of longitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max longitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -180, 180 ].

        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude
             values to be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure levels 
             to be included in the extracted data block.

     Other keywords:
     ===============
        XMID, YMID, ZMID -> Arrays of values (e.g. latitude,
             longitude, or altitude) for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
             dimensions of the DATA array, respectively.  
             NOTE: These are *NOT* index arrays.

        THISDATAINFO -> Returns the DATAINFO structure for the
             selected data block.

        MODELINFO -> Returns to the calling program the model information 
             structure created by CTM_TYPE.
                      
        GRIDINFO -> Returns to the calling program the grid information  
             structure created by CTM_GRID.

        WE -> Returns to the calling program the index array of longitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from west to east.

        SN -> Returns to the calling program the index array of latitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from South to North 
 
        UP -> Returns to the calling program the index array of vertical
             levels for the extracted data region, ordered from surface 
             to top.

        PSURF -> Surface pressure to be used for the conversion from
             sigma layers to pressure and altitude.  For defaults 
             see function CTM_TYPE.

       _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATA
              and CTM_EXTRACT.
 
 OUTPUTS:
        SUCCESS -> Returns 1 if successful or 0 otherwise.
 
        DATA -> A 2D or 3D data array

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================
        CTM_GET_DATA
        CTM_GRID    (function)
        CTM_EXTRACT (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_GET_DATABLOCK returns the extracted data block as the 
        function value.

        (2) CTM_GET_DATABLOCK is meant to be called whenever you need
        to extract data from a punch file.  If the punch file needs
        to be opened, CTM_GET_DATABLOCK will do that automatically
        (via CTM_GET_DATA).  

 EXAMPLE:
   FILENAME  = '~/amalthea/CTM4/run/ctm.pch'
   LAT       = [  -90,  90 ]
   LON       = [ -180, 180 ]
   LEV       = 1
   SUCCESS   = CTM_GET_DATABLOCK( DATA, 'IJ-AVG-$',                 $
                           XIND=XMID, YIND=YMID, ZIND=ZMID,         $
                           THISDATAINFO=THISDATAINFO,               $
                           TRACER=1,           FILENAME=FILENAME,   $
                           GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO,  MODELINFO=MODELINFO, $
                           LEV=LEV,            LAT=LAT,             $
                           LON=LON,            WE=WE,               $
                           SN=SN,              UP=UP )

   IF ( NOT SUCCESS ) THEN RETURN, 0

            ; gets a data block for the IJ-AVG-$ (ND45) diagnostic,
            ; for the first tracer, at the first timestep, with the 
            ; given latitude, longitude, and sigma level ranges.  
            ; Returns FILEINFO, DATAINFO, THISDATAINFO, WE, SN, UP, 
            ; XMID, YMID, and ZMID to the calling program.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 16 Sep 1998: VERSION 1.00
        bmy, 17 Sep 1998: - added FILENAME keyword, so that the file
                            name can be passed back to the calling
                            program. 
        bmy, 18 Sep 1998: VERSION 1.01
                          - now compatible with CTM_EXTRACT v. 1.01
                          - INDEX, SN, WE, UP keywords added
                          - LATRANGE, LONRANGE, LEVRANGE renamed
                            to LAT, LON, LEV (since they may now

                            arrays, but the actual longitude,
                            latitude, or altitude values for each

 NAME:
        CTM_GRID  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Set-up of the model grid for various models. While the
        horizontal grid information can be computed from a few
        basic parameters, the vertical structure is hardwired
        for each model seperately. Currently, the following models
        are supported: GEOS1, GEOS_STRAT, GEOS-3, GEOS-4, GEOS-5,
        GEOS-57, MERRA, GISS_II, GISS_II_PRIME, FSU, FVCCM, and MATCH.
       
 CATEGORY
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Models & Grids, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_GRID( MTYPE [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        MTYPE --> a MODELINFO structure as returned from function 
             CTM_TYPE.  This structure  must contain the following tags: 
             resolution (a 2 element vector with DI, DJ), halfpolar, 
             center180, name, nlayers, ptop, psurf, hybrid.)
 
 OUTPUT:
        RESULT -> A structure, scalor, or vector variable depending 
             on the output keywords below.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        PSURF -> specify surface pressure in mb. Overrides 
            value passed in through modelinfo structure.

        The following keywords define output options. If none of these
        is set, a structure is returned that contains all parameters.
	   IMX     (int   ) -> Maximum I (longitude) dimension  [alt: NLON]
          JMX     (int   ) -> Maximum J (latitude ) dimension  [alt: NLAT]
          DI      (flt   ) -> Delta-I interval between grid box edges
          DJ      (flt   ) -> Delta-J interval between grid box edges
          YEDGE   (fltarr) -> Array of latitude  edges
          YMID    (fltarr) -> Array of latitude  centers
          XEDGE   (fltarr) -> Array of longitude edges   
          XMID    (fltarr) -> Array of longitude centers

          LMX     (int)    -> Maximum altitude level (layers)  [alt: NLAYERS]
          SIGMID  (fltarr) -> Array of sigma center values
          SIGEDGE (fltarr) -> Array of sigma edges
          ETAMID  (fltarr) -> Array of ETA center values
          ETAEDGE (fltarr) -> Array of ETA edge values
          PMID    (fltarr) -> Array of approx. pressure values for sigma ctrs
          PEDGE   (fltarr) -> ditto for sigma edges
          ZMID    (fltarr) -> Array of approx. mean altitudes for sigma ctrs
          ZEDGE   (fltarr) -> ditto. for sigma edges
          AP      (fltarr) -> Hybrid-grid "A" parameters
          BP      (fltarr) -> Hybrid-grid "B" parameters 

        /NO_VERTICAL --> do not return vertical grid info in structure
             In this case the MTYPE structure only needs to contain
             resolution, halfpolar and center180. This keyword is ignored if 
             a specific (vertical) output option is requested.

        DELTAZ_m --> For multi-level 'GENERIC' grids, DELTAZ_m specifies
             the height of each grid level in meters.  DELTAZ_m does not
             apply to any of the GEOS, GISS, etc. grid families.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================
        GETSIGMA   (function)
        GETETA     (function)
        USSA_ALT   (function)
        USSA_PRESS (function)
        ZMID       (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Best if used with function CTM_TYPE.  Also requires functions
        GETSIGMA and GETETA for definition of vertical layers.

 NOTES:
        This routine is not very efficient in that it always computes 
        all the available information. But since it will not be
        called too often and does not handle large amounts of data, 
        we won't worry about computational efficiency here.

 EXAMPLE:
        MTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS1' )
        MGRID = CTM_GRID( MTYPE )

        ; This will define the following structure (help,mgrid,/stru)

           AP              

        ; Or, with the use of output keywords:
             PRINT, CTM_GRID( CTM_TYPE( 'GISS_II' ), /PMID )

        ; IDL will print

 NAME:
        CTM_INDEX

 PURPOSE:
        Return index of CTM grid boxes for given coordinates
        (or vice versa) and allow user to interactively select
        a grid box

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Models & Grids

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_INDEX, <minfo | ginfo > [,i,j] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        MINFO --> Model type strucure as returned by CTM_TYPE.PRO
     or GINFO --> Model grid structure as returned by CTM_GRID.PRO
            If neither is given, the user will be prompted for a model 
            type and the grid will be computed.

        I, J --> index pair for which lon, lat coordinates shall
            be found if keyword /GET_COORDINATES is set. Also used 
            to return index values for given lon, lat pairs (this is 
            the default operation).  NOTE: I and J will be in "FORTRAN"  
            notation (e.g. the starting from 1 and not zero). To index
            IDL arrays, be sure to use I-1 and J-1. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        CENTER --> a two element vector with (LAT, LON) coordinates
            for which the gridbox index shall be returned. Also used
            to return center coordinates for a given index pair if
            keyword /GET_COORDINATES is set.

        EDGE --> a four element vector in the MAP_SET LIMIT format
            (LAT0, LON0, LAT1, LON1). If keyword GET_COORDINATES is
            not set and no CENTER coordinates are given, I and J will 
            return two element vectors with I(0) corresponding to LON0 
            and I(1) corresponding to LON1 etc. In this case, it may
            be useful to retrieve WE_INDEX and SN_INDEX for indexing
            of CTM data arrays (note that these indices follow the IDL
            convention, i.e. starting from 0. To convert them into "true"
            CTM indices, add 1).
            If CENTER coordinates are provided or /GET_COORDINATES is set 
            then EDGE returns the grid box edges for the given or calculated 
            index pair.

        WE_INDEX --> integer array for indexing of CTM data arrays. This
            keyword is only used when EDGE is a valid 4 element vector,
            keyword GET_COORDINATES is not set and no coordinates are 
            passed in the CENTER keyword. This array is always arranged
            in west-east order (e.g. for EDGE=[0.,175.,0.,-175.] it will
            return [70, 71, 0] (GEOS1 grid)). 

        SN_INDEX --> like WE_INDEX but for latitude indexing. Note that
            latitude values in EDGE must be arranged in ascending order.

        /GET_COORDINATES --> return coordinates to given index rather
            than an index pair for given coordinates
        
        /NON_INTERACTIVE --> default action is interactive box picking per
            mouse (only need to supply MINFO in this case, but index and
            coordinates of last click will be returned in I, J, CENTER
            and EDGES repectively). Set this keyword if you want to convert
            values to and fro without drawing a map etc.

        XSIZE, YSIZE --> window size (default 900x600)

        MAPCENTER --> center coordinates for map projection [p0lat, polon ]

        COUNTRIES -> draw country boundaries

        _EXTRA --> keywords are passed to MAP_SET 
            (e.g. LIMIT=[lat0,lon0,lat1,lon1])
            Careful if you display data!

        WINDOW -> window number to plot into. Normally a new window
            is opened with the /free option. Use a specific window number
            to overlay the map onto existing data plotted with tvimage
             (see example).

        DATA -> a data array with dimensions matching your model grid
            (no error checking on this!) If DATA contains data, the value
            at the selected grid box, and a statistic for neighbouring 
            grid boxes will be displayed together with the corrdinates.

 OUTPUTS:
        Index of grid box in I, J, coordinates in named variables supplied
        with CENTER and EDGE keywords

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        needs CTM_TYPE for input of MINFO parameter and 
        CTM_DEFINE_GRID 

 NOTES:
        This routine makes substantial use of recursive calls. Be careful
        when changing.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        CTM_INDEX, CTM_TYPE('GEOS1')

             ; Display world map and have fun. 

        (2)
        CTM_INDEX, CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS1',RESOLUTION=2 ), $
            I, J, LIMIT=[ 0.,-180., 90., -30. ]

             ; Display map of North America and select grid 
             ; boxes for GEOS 2x2.5 grid.
             ; Indices of last point are returned in I and J.

        (3)
        CTM_INDEX, CTM_TYPE('GISS_II_PRIME'),$
             I, J, CENTER=[ 42., -72.], /NON_INTERACTIVE
        print,I,J

             ; returns grid box index for Harvard Forest in 
             ; GISS CTM II' (21,33) without displaying a map

        (4)
        CTM_INDEX, CTM_TYPE('GISS_II'), $
             I, J, EDGE=[-25.,170.,0.,-100.], $
             WE_INDEX=WE, SN_INDEX=SN, /NON_INTERACTIVE

             ; returns [ 69, 70, 71, 0, 1, ... , 15 ] in WE and 
             ; [ 15, 16, ..., 21 ] in SN. I is [ 70, 16 ], and J 
             ; is [ 16, 22 ]. Note that I, J refer to CTM (= FORTRAN)
             ;  indices, whereas WS and SN are IDL array indices.
        
        (5) 
        IM    = BYTSCL( DATA,MAX=MAX(DATA))
        MINFO = CTM_TYPE( 'GENERIC', RES=[360./XDIM,180./YDIM] )
        GINFO = CTM_GRID(MINFO)
        TVIMAGE, IM, POSITION=P, /KEEP_ASPECT
        CTM_INDEX, GINFO, I, J, WINDOW=0, DATA=DATA

             ; Overlay interactive map onto data displayed with 
             ; TVIMAGE.  You should create a generic MODELINFO 
             ; structure in this case.  NOTE: replace xdim, ydim 
             ; with the dimensions of your data array!
             ; This example also demonstrates the use of ginfo vs. minfo.

             These values can be combined. E.g., to integrate over 
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE 
             supersedes the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see above).


        FORMAT -> Specifies format for converting numeric values into
             string values, for selected fields (such as LAT and LON).
             Default is I14 (strings are trimmed).

 NAME:
        CTM_LOCATEDIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Locates data blocks which differ in two binary
        punch files or GMAO met field files.  

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_LOCATEDIFF, FILE1, FILE2 [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FILE1 -> Name of the first file to be tested.  FILE1 may be
             a binary punch file, and ASCII file, or a GMAO met field
             file.

        FILE2 -> Name of the second file to be tested.  FILE2 may be
             a binary punch file, and ASCII file, or a GMAO met field
             file.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name to restrict the selection
             of data records.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the output file which will contain
             the location of differences found between data blocks
             in FILE1 and FILE2.  If OUTFILENAME is not specified,
             then CTM_LOCATEDIFF will print this information to
             the screen.

        /HEADERS_ONLY -> Set this switch to just print the category
             names and tracer numbers where differences occur instead
             of printing all of the data points.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATA.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

        CTM_DIAGINFO

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS directories.

 NOTES:
        (1) Both FILE1 and FILE2 must contain the same diagnostic 
            categories, listed in the same order.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_LOCATEDIFF, 'ctm.bpch.old', 'ctm.bpch.new'

             ; Locates data blocks which differ between ctm.bpch.old
             ; and ctm.bpch.new.  You can investigate these further
             ; with routines CTM_PRINTDIFF and CTM_PLOTDIFF.

 NAME:
        CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Create a datainfo and fileinfo structure from an
        "external" data set so that it can be used seamlessly
        within the GAMAP package. The dataset can have up to
        four dimensions (however, only the first 3 are currently
        supported). The new datainfo and fileinfo structures 
        will be added to the global structure arrays.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO( DATA, DATAINFO, FILEINFO  [,Keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA  -> A 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D data array.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostics name (category) or number that describes
               the data type. If not given, the user will be prompted.
               If DIAGN is a number that is not recognized as valid
               diagnostics by CTM_DIAGINFO, the number will be stored
               as string value. If DIAGN is a string, it does not have 
               to be a valid diagnostics category.

        DIM -> A 4 element vector with the DATA dimensions as
               LON, LAT, LEVEL, TIME. If not given, the dimensions
               of DATA will be entered sequentially. Use this keyword
               to properly identify e.g. a zonal mean data set as
               DIM = [ 0, 46, 20, 0 ] (for the GEOS-1).
               The order and magnitude of the dimensions in DIM must
               agree with the dimensions of the DATA array
               (e.g. if DATA(72,46) then DIM=[46,72,0,0] is not allowed).

        FILENAME-> Name of the file which is specified by the
               FILEINFO structure.  If FILENAME is not specified, 
               then the default FILENAME = "derived data".

        FILETYPE -> A numeric code to identify the file type.  If not
               specified then the default FILETYPE = -1.

        FIRSTBOX -> A 3 element vector containing IFIRST, JFIRST, and
               LFIRST, which are the starting indices for the LON,
               LAT, and LEVEL dimensions.  

        FORMAT -> A format string (for ASCII data) or descriptive
               string (for binary or self-describing data) that is
               saved to the DATAINFO structure.  Default is ''.

        GRIDINFO -> A gridinfo structure describing the grid set-up
               of the data set (see CTM_GRID). If not given, 
               CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO attempts to use the MODELINFO 
               structure to construct GRIDINFO.

        ILUN -> The file unit number that will be used to identify 
               FILEINFO and DATAINFO.  If not passed, then ILUN will
               be negative to denote derived data, and will increment
               negatively for each data block, starting at -1. 

        MODELINFO -> A modelinfo structure containing information
               about the model that generated the data (see CTM_TYPE).
               If not given, the user is prompted for a selection.

        /NO_GLOBAL -> If passed, will prevent the DATAINFO and FILEINFO
               structures from being appended to the global GAMAP
               common blocks.  Useful for saving memory.

        /NO_VERTICAL (passed via _EXTRA) -> set this keyword if you only want
               to create a 2D gridfinfo structure.

        TAU0, TAU1 -> Beginning and end of time interval that is spanned
               by DATA (as TAU value). Default is -1 for both.

        TOPTITLE -> A user defined string that may describe the data set
               in more detail.

        TRACER -> A tracer number or name that identifies the chemical 
               species or physical quantity contained in DATA. If 
               TRACER is an invalid name, it will be set to -1, and the
               string value of TRACER will be used as TRCNAME (see below). 
               If not given, the user will be prompted.

        TRCNAME -> A tracer name. Default is to use the name associated
               with that tracer number in CTM_TRACERINFO.

        SCALE -> A value that is entered in the SCALE field in DATAINFO.
               Default is 1.0.

        UNIT -> A unit string. Default is empty.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATAINFO, FILEINFO -> The datainfo and fileinfo structures
               generated from the "external" data array. These are 
               automatically appended to the global DATAINFO and FILEINFO 
               structures, unless the /NO_GLOBAL keyword is set.

 PURPOSE:
        Computes the NOy budget within a given 3-D region.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_NOYBUDGET [, BATCHFILE [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        BATCHFILE (optional) -> Name of the batch file which 
             contains inputs that defines the 3-D region and NOy
             constituents.  If BATCHFILE is omitted, then the user
             will be prompted to supply a file name via a dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LOGFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the log file where output 
             will be sent.  Default is "noy_budget.log".

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_NOYBUDGET was developed for use with the GEOS-CTM,
            there might be some adaptation required for use with
            other models.

        (2) Only 5 "families" are considered: 
            Dry Deposition, NOx, PAN, HNO3, R4N2.

        (3) Wrapping around the date line seems to work but you
            should always double-check.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_NOYBUDGET, 'box1.dat', LogFileName='box1.log'
           
             ; Computes NOy budgets for the region specified in
             ; the file "box1.dat" and sends output to the 
             ; "box1.log" log file.

 NAME:
        CTM_OPEN_FILE

 PURPOSE:
        Open a CTM output (punch) file and reads the complete
        header information from that file. The file may be either
        ASCII or binary type, and is only opened if not already 
        parsed. It is re-opened if it was parsed but closed in the 
        meantime. CTM_OPEN_FILE can also be used to read GEOS-CTM
        restart files. However, since it is not possible to
        point randomly at these data, the complete set of tracers
        in a restart file will be read at once.
        
        While in general files are opened automatically when 
        CTM_GET_DATA is used, there are several circumstances where
        direct use of CTM_OPEN_FILE advantageous:
        * if a read error occurs, use CTM_OPEN_FILE with the /PRINT
          keyword to diagnose the error
        * to compare two model runs, it is simpler to first open
          the two files, then call CTM_GET_DATA without the filename
          keyword. All operations will then be done on both files
          in parallel.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_OPEN_FILE, FILENAME, THISFILEINFO, THISDATAINFO

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> The name of the file to be opened or a
            file mask. If the file was not found or the file 
            mask contains wild cards, a pickfile dialog is
            opened for interactive selection. The default
            search mask can be set in gamap.defaults (see
            GAMAP_INIT).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        CANCELLED -> Returns 1 if the CANCEL button was pressed
            during DIALOG PICKFILE filename selection.
 
        _EXTRA keywords are passed to the various routines which
            read the file headers.  

 OUTPUTS:
        THISFILEINFO -> A named variable that will contain a 
            fileinfo structure (see CREATE3DFSTRU).

        THISDATAINFO -> A named variable that will contain an
            array of datainfo structures (see CREATE3DHSTRU)
            associated with this file.

        THISFILEINFO and THISDATAINFO are also appended to the 
        global pointer variables pGlobalFileInfo and pGlobalDataInfo
        (see gamap_cmn.pro and GAMAP_INIT).

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================================
        Get_Free_Lun  (function)   Test_For_NCDF          (function)
        Test_For_HDF  (function)   Test_For_HDFEOS        (function)
        Test_For_GMAO (function)   Test_For_Binary        (function)
        File_Parse    (function)   File_Opened_Previously (function)
        Handle_Prev_Opened_File

        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================================================
        GAMAP_CMN          (incl file)  OPEN_FILE
        CTM_READ3DB_HEADER (function )  CTM_READ3DB_HEADER (function)
        CTM_READ_GMAO      (function )  CTM_READ_NCDF      (function) 
        CTM_READ_GMI       (function )  LITTLE_ENDIAN      (function)
        STRRIGHT           (function )

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) In internal function "test_for_dao", add additional met 
        field names as is necessary to the FIELDNAMES array.  The
        first met field name in a file is tested against FIELDNAMES.
        If there is a match, then the file is declared to be a DAO 
        met field file, and it is assigned a file type of 4.

        (2) You must also add additional met field names to routine
        "ctm_read_dao" as is necessary.  The DAO met field files do 
        not carry tracer numbers, so the name of each met field must
        be checked in "ctm_read_dao" before a corresponding DATAINFO
        structure can be assigned.

        (3) If a binary file is the wrong endian, we will get a
        "Corrupted F77 file error" when we try to read data from it.
        We now test for this error in routines TEST_FOR_BINARY and
        TEST_FOR_DAO.  If this error condition occurs, the file is
        re-opened with the /SWAP_ENDIAN command.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_OPEN_FILE
        ; queries the user for a filename and stores the analyzed
        ; header information in the global common block
        ; If an ASCII punch file is read, the user is prompted for
        ; a model name

        CTM_OPEN_FILE,'',fileinfo,datainfo
        ; opens a CTM punch file after selection from a pickfile
        ; dialog

        CTM_OPEN_FILE,'~/amalthea/CTM4/run/ctm.pch',fileinfo,datainfo
        ; opens the specified punch file

 NAME:
        CTM_OVERLAY

 PURPOSE:
        Calls TVMAP to plot a pixel or contour map and then overplots 
        either an aircraft flight track or individual station data 
        atop it.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_OVERLAY, DATA,   XMID,   YMID, $
                     TRACKD, TRACKX, TRACKY [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> Data array (e.g. from CTM_GET_DATA or CTM_GET_DATABLOCK)
             from which a pixel plot or contour plot will be generated.

        XMID -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to DATA.

        YMID -> Vector of latitudes corresponding to DATA

        TRACKD -> Vector of data values corresponding to the aircraft
             flight track or station data points.

        TRACKX -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to the aircraft 
             flight track or station data points.  Should be in the 
             range [-180,180].

        TRACKY -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to the aircraft
             flight track or station data points.  Should be in the 
             range [-90,90].

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        C_COLORS -> Vector to specify the color levels for filled
             contour plots.  If not passed, then C_COLORS will return
             to the calling program the default color level values
             generated internally by TVMAP.
 
        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing contour levels for filled
             contour plots.  Used in conjunction with /FCONTOUR. 

        COLOR -> Color of the map outline.  Passed to TVMAP.

        /FCONTOUR -> Set this switch to generate a filled-contour
             plot instead of a pixel plot.

        /LOG -> Set this switch to use a logarithmic color table.

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of DATA.  If omitted, then MINDATA
             will be automatically set to the minimum value of DATA.

        MAXDATA -> Minimum value of DATA.  If omitted, then MINDATA
             will be automatically set to the minimum value of DATA.

        /OVERPLOT -> Set this keyword to overplot a flight track
             atop a map previously drawn by TVMAP.

        T_COLOR -> (1) If plotting aircraft flight track data, then
             T_COLOR will be used to define the color of the line.
             (2) If plotting symbol data, then T_COLOR will be used to
             describe the color of the border around the symbol.  
             To suppress printing a border around the symbol, use
             any negative value for T_COLOR (e.g. T_COLOR = -1).

        T_LINESTYLE -> IDL linestyle for the aircraft flight track.
             Takes same values as the LINESTYLE graphic keyword
             (see help pages).

        T_SYMBOL -> Argument to the SYM keyword, which will be used
             to define the individual data points if you are plotting
             station data.  Recommended value: 1 (filled circle).

        T_THICK -> Thickness of the aircraft flight track, in pixels.
 
        _EXTRA=e -> Passes extra keywords to TVMAP and OPLOT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

                            renamed to CTM_OVERLAY
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
  dbm & bmy, 06 Nov 2007: - Modified to allow filled contour plots
  cdh & bmy, 18 Feb 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Now pass LOG=LOG to TVMAP call to ensure
                            that TVMAP gets the /LOG keyword OK
  bmy & cph, 14 Jan 2010: GAMAP VERSION 2.14
                          - Remove the call to the PLOT command after
                            TVMAP. This does set up the approropriate
                            coordinates for map projections other
                            than /CYLINDRICAL.
                          - Now use PLOTS to plot symbols or lines
                            rather than OPLOT.
                          - Updated comments

                            for filled contour plots if not specified
   bf & bmy, 18 Oct 2010: - Bug fix submitted by Bonne Ford to allow
                            more than one overlay on the same plot
        bmy, 10 Feb 2016: GAMAP VERSION 2.19
                          - If plotting symbols, suppress symbol borders
                            if T_COLOR is negative (e.g. T_COLOR=-1).
                          - Now require adding /NOADVANCE before each 
                            successive call to CTM_OVERLAY with /OVERPLOT

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_OXBUDGET [, BATCHFILE [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        BATCHFILE (optional) -> Name of the batch file which 
             contains inputs that defines the 3-D region and NOy
             constituents.  If BATCHFILE is omitted, then the user
             will be prompted to supply a file name via a dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LOGFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the log file where output 
             will be sent.  Default is "ox_budget.log".

 OUTPUTS:

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_OXBUDGET was developed for use with the GEOS-CTM,
            there might be some adaptation required for use with
            other models.  

        (2) Only 2 "families" are considered: Dry Deposition and Ox.

        (3) Wrapping around the date line seems to work but you
            should always double-check.

        (4) Currently, the box of consideration must be less than
            global size in order to m
       
 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_OXBUDGET, 'box1.ox', LogFileName='box1.log'
           
             ; Computes Ox budgets for the region specified in
             ; the file "box1.ox" and sends output to the 
             ; "box1.log" log file.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOT

 PURPOSE:
        General plotting tool for CTM data that is stored in the 
        GAMAP datainfo and fileinfo structures. CTM_PLOT can 
        handle everything from 0-D to 3-D and has many different
        plot options, especially for 2-D plots for which it was
        originally designed. E.g. full map support.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOT, [ Diagn [ [ ,Keywords ] ] 

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> The diagnostic number (e.g. ND22, ND45, etc or 
             category name (e.g. "JV-MAP", "IJ-AVG") for which to 
             read data from the punch file. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    Keyword parameters passed to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK:
    ===============================================
        FILENAME -> Name of the punch file to read data from.  
             FILENAME is passed to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.  You can also
             use a file mask, in which case FILENAME will return the 
             full filename if it is a named variable. If an empty 
             filename is provided, the default search mask from 
             gamap.defaults (see gamap.cmn) will be used. If no 
             filename is given, ctm_plot will try 
             to find the records from data already loaded.

        TRACER -> Number of tracer to read from the punch file.

        TAU0, /FIRST, /LAST -> time step to be plotted

        LON -> If /INDEX is set, LON denotes the CTM longitude index
             of the box to plot.  Otherwise, LON denotes the actual
             longitude value of that box. (that is at box CENTER, phs
             4/2/08)

        LAT -> If /INDEX is set, LAT denotes the CTM latitude index
             of the box to plot.  Otherwise, LAT denotes the actual
             latitude value of that box. (that is at box CENTER, phs
             4/2/08)

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element
             vector specifying the min and max sigma levels to be 
             included in the plot.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].
 
        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude
             values to be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure 
             levels to be included in the extracted data block.

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as CTM 
             indices.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON
             as the actual values of latitude, level, and longitude.
             NOTE: If /INDEX is set, then GAMAP cannot create plots
             for longitude ranges that span the date line!!!

        AVERAGE -> If = 0, will not average the data 
                      = 1, will average data longitudinally
                      = 2, will average data latitudinally
                      = 4, will average data vertically
             These are cumulative (e.g. AVERAGE=3 will average over 
             both lat and lon, and AVERAGE=7 will average over lat,
             lon, and vertical levels to produce 1 data point).
                       
        TOTAL -> If = 0, will not total data
                    = 1, will total data longitudinally
                    = 2, will total data latitudinally
                    = 4, will total data vertically
             These are cumulative (e.g. TOTAL=3 will total over both 
             lat and lon, and TOTAL=7 will total over lat, lon, and 
             vertical levels to produce 1 data point).

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATABLOCK will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO and USE_DATAINFO must be consistent, and should
             either both be used or omitted. However, it is
             possible to provide the global FILEINFO structure 
             (or nothing) with a local subset of DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

    Keywords passed to CTM_CONVERT_UNIT:
    ====================================
        UNIT -> Name of the unit that the DATA array will be converted
             to. If not specified, then no unit conversion will be done.

    Keywords passed to TVMAP or TVPLOT:
    ===================================
        NOERASE -> Do not erase previous plot.
 
        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of map on the plot. POSITION
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08]. (Passed to TVMAP).

        NCOLORS -> This is the maximum color index that will be used.

        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be loaded
             used in the color map and color bar.

        /NOCBAR -> If set, will not plot the colorbar below the map
             in the position specified by CBPOSITION.  Default is to
             plot a colorbar.

        CBCOLOR -> Color index of the colorbar outline and
             characters.  Defaults to BLACK (from colors_default.pro).

        CBPOSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the colorbar. BARPOSITION 
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08]. 

        CBUNIT -> Passes the Unit string to COLORBAR, which will be
             plotted to the right of the color bar.  NOTE: For black
             & white contour plots, the string specified by CBUNIT
             will be plotted below the X-axis.  

        CBFORMAT -> format to use in call to colorbar. Default is I12
             if abs(max(data)) < 1e4, else e12.2 (strings get trimmed)

        COLOR  -> Color index of the map outline and title characters.  
             Defaults to BLACK (from colors_default.pro). Also used as
             plot color for 1-D (line) plots.

        MPARAM -> A 3 element vector containing values for
             [ P0Lat, P0Lon, Rot ].  Default is [ 0, 0, 0 ].

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]. 

        TITLE -> The title string that is to be placed atop the
             map window.  

        /NOCONTINENTS -> If set, will suppress adding continent lines
             to the map.  Default is to call MAP_CONTINENTS to plot
             continent outlines or filled boundaries.

        CCOLOR -> The color index of the continent outline or fill 
             region.  Default is BLACK (from colors_default.pro).
 
        CFILL -> Value passed to FILL_CONTINENTS keyword of
             MAP_CONTINENTS.  If CFILL=1 then will fill continents
             with a solid color (as specified in CCOLOR above).  
             If CFILL=2 then will fill continents with hatching.

        /NOGRID -> If set, will suppress printing of grid lines.
             Default is to call MAP_GRID to overlay grid lines.
 
        GCOLOR -> The color index of the grid lines.
             Default is BLACK (from colors_default.pro)

        /NOGLABELS -> Will suppres printing of labels for each grid
             line in TVMAP.PRO.  Default is to print grid labels
             for each grid line.

        /NOISOTROPIC -> Will suppress plotting of an isotropic map
             (i.e. one with the same X and Y scale).  Default is to 
             print an isotropic map.
  
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the 
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map. If you find
             that one or more color bands are not filled properly, 
             try the /CELL_FILL keyword. This is a known IDL precularity.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, TVMAP will use quasi-logarithmic levels.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for each line (or
             each fill section) of the contour map.  If not
             specified, TVMAP will select default colors from the 
             colortable.

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS 
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector, 
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS 
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise, 
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the 
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to 
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling. 

             NOTE: If C_LABELS is given as a scalar, then it will be
             expanded to a vector with all elements having the same value.

        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.

        /OVERPLOT -> Add an additional line plot to an existing one.
             You should specify LINE=n and/or COLOR=n to distinguish 
             between curves in this case. You can manually add a legend
             with legend.pro after the plot(s) are produced.
             Note that the title string will contain information on 
             your first selection only. Use an explicit TITLE for 
             best results.

        /SAMPLE -> Will cause REBIN (in TVMAP) to use nearest-
             neighbor sampling rather than bilinear interpolation.

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are quasi-logarithmic.

        /POLAR -> Create a polar plot. Note that the longitude range must 
             be -180..180 and the latitude range must extend to one pole
             but not straddle the equator.


    Keywords passed to ISOPLETH_MAP:
    ================================
        ISOPLETH -> Value for which a 3-D isosurface will be computed.
             ISOPLETH_MAP assigns a default value of 35.0.  


    Other Keywords:
    ===============
        USTR -> Unit string to be plotted to the right of the colorbar.  
             If not specified, then CTM_PLOT  will construct a unit 
             string based on the value of TRACERINFO.UNIT.
             NOTE: USTR is a synonym for the keyword CBUNIT, which
             specifies the color bar unit string.

        THISDATAINFO -> Returns to the calling program the THISDATAINFO
             structure obtained by CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.

        LABELSTRU -> Returns to the calling program the structure
             of label information obtained by CTM_LABEL.
 
        YRANGE -> range of y values for color scaling (default:
             scale each plot seperately with data min and max)

        X_FORMAT, Y_FORMAT (optional) -> Specifies the format string
             (e.g. '(f10.3)', '(e14.2)' ) for the X and Y axes, when
             making line plots.  If omitted, CTM_PLOT will call
             GET_DEFAULTFORMAT to compute default format strings. 

        RESULT -> A named variable will contain the data subset that was
             plotted together with the X and/or Y coordinates in a structure.
             For 1D plots, either X or Y are -1. 3D visualization returns
             a structure including the Z coordinate.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATABLOCK,
             CTM_LABEL, TVMAP, and TVPLOT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===========================================================
        CTM_DRAW_CUBE                  CONVERT_LON
        CTM_TRACERINFO                 CTM_CONVERT_UNIT
        TVMAP                          TVPLOT

        GET_DEFAULTFORMAT (function)   GAMAP_CMN     (include file)   

        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        Also assumes colortable has been loaded with "myct.pro". 

 NOTES:
        (1) Some keywords are saved in local variables with 
        slightly different names (e.g. MCONTOUR for /CONTOUR) 
        to prevent confusion with routine names and/or keywords
        that are picked up by the _EXTRA=e facility.

        (2) Not every possible combination of keywords has been thoroghly 
        tested. *PLEASE* report reproducible errors to mgs@io.harvard.edu!!

        (3) As of 11/17/98, CTM_PLOT can only produce X-Y plots with
        either PRESSURE or ALTITUDE along the left Y-Axis.  The right
        Y-Axis is left disabled (but will fix that later on...) 

        (4) Now define X-axis labels for longitude.  The labels are
        defined correctly for data blocks that span the date line.

 EXAMPLE:
        (0)
        CTM_PLOT
             ; To plot an ozone surface map (default) of a 
             ; user-selected file

        (1)
        FileName = '~/terra/CTM4/run_code/ctm.pch.sep1'
        CTM_PLOT, 22, 1, FileName=FileName, Lev=[1,14], $
           Total=4, /NoErase 

             ; Plots vertically-summed map for tracer 1 of ND22
             ; (J-Values map).  Will erase screen before plotting map.

        (2)
        CTM_PLOT, 'JV-MAP-$', 1, FileName=FileName, Lev=[1,14], $
           Total=4, /NoErase 

             ; Same as above, but uses category name instead of 
             ; diagnostic number.

                            (interface to TVPLOT) : ** still needs work! **
                          - changed CBAR to NOCBAR
        bmy, 12 Nov 1998: - TRACER is now a keyword instead of
                            an argument
                          - Changed keyword CONTINENTS to

        bmy, 13 Nov 1998: - VERSION 3.00
                          - ***** RENAMED to CTM_PLOT *****
                          - updated documentation header
                          - renamed C_LABELS to C_ANNOTATION to
                            prevent keyword name confusion
                          - added NOLINES, NOLABELS, C_LABELS,
                            and OVERLAYCOLOR keywords for tvmap
                          - now gets default colors from 
                            DEFAULT_COLORS.PRO
                          - Error checking for LIMIT keyword
                            (OK for now...fix this later on...)
        bmy, 16 Nov 1998: - Now use %DATE% instead of %YMD1% for
                            all default plot titles
                          - now enhanced for TVPLOT v. 2.0
                          - now only convert units for a tracer 
                            if the default unit is different from
                            the desired unit!!
        bmy, 17 Nov 1998: - added /PRESSURE keyword to plot pressure
                            instead of altitude on the left Y-axis
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998: - messed around quite a bit, because of 
                            (unfortunate) changes in default_range !@#$!@
                          - added CBFormat keyword
        bmy, 23 Nov 1998: - eliminated %SCALE% token from UNITSTR,
                            to be consistent with the latest
                            upgrade to COLORBAR.PRO. 
                          - now pass SECONDS to CTM_CONVERT_UNIT
        bmy, 13 Jan 1999: - add support for line plots.  Also, if
                            the DATA array is averaged down to a
                            single point, will print the value of
                            that point and exit.
                          - use NEWXTITLE and NEWYTITLE as token-replaced
                            strings for XTITLE and YTITLE
        bmy, 15 Jan 1999: - add support for 3-D visualization plots
                          - added unit string for contour plots
                          - now place CTM_LABEL call after the case
                            statement for PLOTTYPE, so that we can
                            suppress printing of special characters

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Prints a lat-lon map of 2 CTM fields, their absolute difference, 
        and their percent difference.  This is a quick way of ensuring 
        that two model versions are producing identical results.

        The page will contain the following plot panels:

             Panel #1               Panel #2
             Data Block D1          Data Block D2

             Panel #3               Panel #4
             Abs Diff (D2 - D1)     % Diff (D2 - D1)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF, DIAGN, FILE1, FILE2 [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: "IJ-AVG-$"). 

        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file.  If FILE1
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file.  If FILE2
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:


        LON -> A 2-element vector specifying the longitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-180,180].

        LAT -> A 2-element vector specifying the latitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-88,88].

        LEV -> A scalar or 2-element vector which specifies the
             level(s) that will be used to make the plot.  Default
             is [ 1, 1 ].

        /PS -> Set this switch to print to a PostScript file.
 
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the PostScript file if the /PS option 
             is set.  Default is "idl.ps".

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which differences will be plotted.  

        TAU0 -> TAU value(s) (hours since 0 GMT 1 Jan 1985) at the start
             of the diagnostic data block to plot.

        DIVISIONS -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the quantity plot (Panels #1 and #2).  Default is 5.
             NOTE: The optimal # of divisions is !MYCT.NCOLORS/2 +1.

        DATARANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values of the data that will appear on the plot (Panels
             # 1 and #2).  The default is to automatically compute
             the overall min and max of both data blocks.

        MIN_VALID -> Specifies the minimum valid data for the plot. 
             Data lower than MIN_VALID will be rendered with color
             !MYCT.WHITE.  For example, MIN_VALID is useful for
             plotting emissions which only occur on land.

        DIFFDIV -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 8.
             NOTE: The optimal # of divisions is !MYCT.NCOLORS/2 +1.

        DIFFNCOLORS -> Sets the # of colors used to create the
             difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 13.

        DIFFRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the absolute difference
             plot (Panel #3).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the absolute difference data (symmetric around zero).

        /NODEVICE -> set to not call open_device, so you can do it
             from outside

        /NOMULTIPANEL -> set to not call multipanel, so you can do it
             from outside

        PCRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the percentage difference
             plot (Panel #4).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the percentage difference data (symmetric around zero).

        PCDIV -> number of ticks in the %-Diff colorbar

        PCNCOLORS -> number of colors for the %-Diff plot

        T1, T2, DIFFTITLE -> allows you to overwrite the default
             title for the 1st, 2nd and DIff plots.


        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_DIFF,
             OPEN_DEVICE, and MYCT


   Keywords for the MASK feature:
   ------------------------------
        /MASK -> set to mask with a green color boxes where %-diff
             and/or diff are below some threshold. The absolute value
             of the % is plot.

	 PC_THR, DIFF_THR : the %-Diff and Diff THResholds to mask data in the
             4th plot if /MASK is set. Boxes with %-Diff or/and Diff
             below the THResholds are masked. Default values are 1%
             and 1e4.

        /ZAP -> set to skip all plots if /MASK is set and all boxes
             are masked.


 OUTPUTS:
        none

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =======================================================
        CHKSTRU     (function)    CLOSE_DEVICE 
        CTM_CLEANUP               COLORBAR_NDIV     (function)
        CTM_DIFF                  CTM_GET_DATABLOCK (function)

        MULTIPANEL                OPEN_DEVICE
        

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_PLOTDIFF calls CTM_CLEANUP each time to remove
            previously read datablock info from the GAMAP common
            block.

        (2) The default TAU0 value is 0, and is not suitable if your 
            run has no output for 0 GMT 1 Jan 1985! You may have to 
            gather tau0 before running and crashing CTM_PLOTDIFF.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILE1 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-30'
        FILE2 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-31'
        CTM_PLOTDIFF, 'IJ-AVG-$', FILE1, FILE2, TRACER=1

             ; Creates 4-panel plot w/ old data, new data,
             ; new - old (abs diff), and new - old (% diff).

        bmy, 05 Nov 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Renamed YRANGE keyword to DATARANGE in
                            order to avoid confusion with nested grids
        phs, 22 Sep 2009: - more flexible call to MYCT for diff
                            plots, so it can be overwriten from
                            caller
                          - Can select number of colors and divisions
                            for %-diff plot
                          - Can overwrite titles
                          - Can set Multipanel from outside in caller
                          - Can MASK data according to both Diff and
                            %-Diff values, in the 4th plot
        bmy, 29 Jan 2010: GAMAP VERSION 2.14
                          - Minor fix in IF statement to prevent code
                            from dying after call to CTM_DIFF.

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF4

 PURPOSE:
        Prints a lat-lon map of 2 CTM fields, their absolute difference, 
        and their percent difference.  This is a quick way of ensuring 
        that two model versions are producing identical results.

        The page will contain the following plot panels:

             Panel #1               Panel #2
             Data Block D1          Data Block D2

             Panel #3               Panel #4
             Abs Diff (D2 - D1)     % Diff (D2 - D1) / D1

        CTM_PLOTDIFF4 is a lighter version of CTM_PLOTDIFF, and does
        not use CTM_DIFF as an intermediary routine. 

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF4, DIAGN, FILE2, FILE2 [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: "IJ-AVG-$"). 

        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file.  If FILE1
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file.  If FILE2
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        LON -> A 2-element vector specifying the longitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-180,180].

        LAT -> A 2-element vector specifying the latitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-88,88].

        LEV -> A scalar or 2-element vector which specifies the
             level(s) that will be used to make the plot.  Default
             is [ 1, 1 ].

        /PS -> Set this switch to print to a PostScript file.
 
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the PostScript file if the /PS option 
             is set.  Default is "idl.ps".

        TRACER -> A scalar or 2-element vector which specifies the
             tracer number(s) for each data block.  

        TAU0 -> A scalar or 2-element vector which specifies the
             TAU value(s) (hours since 0 GMT 1 Jan 1985) by which
             each data block is timestamped.

        DIVISIONS -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the quantity plot (Panels #1 and #2).  Default is 5.

   ------------------------------
        /MASK -> set to mask with a green color boxes where %-diff
             and/or diff are below some threshold. The absolute value
             of the % is plot.

	 PC_THR, DIFF_THR : the %-Diff and Diff THResholds to mask
	      data in the 4th plot (percent difference) if /MASK is
	      set.  Boxes with %-Diff or/and Diff below the THResholds
	      are masked. Default values are 1% and 1e4.

        /ZAP -> set to skip all plots if /MASK is set and all boxes
             are masked.;

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        (1) When plotting a subset of the globe, CTM_PLOTDIFF4
            properly sets the colorbar ranges for the abs diff
            and percent diff plots.  This was an issue in the
            older CTM_PLOTDIFF.

        (2) Longitude and latitude ranges specified by LON and LAT
            will be applied to both data blocks.  

 EXAMPLE:
         CTM_PLOTDIFF4, 'IJ-AVG-$',                      $
                        'v8-03-02.bpch', 'v9-01-01.bpch, $
                        TRACER=6,      LEVEL=1,          $
                        LON=[-90,-30], LAT=[30,15]
 
             ; Creates a 4-panel difference plot for ISOPRENE
             ; (IJ-AVG-$, tracer #6) at the surface for the Amazon
             ; basin region from data in 2 different model versions.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file (containing the
             "old" data).  If FILE1 is not given, or if it contains 
             wildcard characters (e.g. "*"), then the user will be 
             prompted to supply a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file.  If FILE2
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        LON -> A 2-element vector specifying the longitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-180,180].

        LAT -> A 2-element vector specifying the latitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-88,88].

        LEV -> Vertical level for which to plot data.  Default is 1.

        OPEN_DEVICE   CLOSE_DEVICE
        MULTIPANEL

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) The ratio plotted will be DATA2 / DATA1, where DATA2
            is contained in FILE2, and DATA1 is contained in FILE1.

        (2) For places where DATA1 = 0, DATA2 will also be set to 0.
            This avoids division by zero errors.

        (3) CTM_PLOTRATIO calls CTM_CLEANUP each time to remove
            previously read datablock info from the GAMAP common
            block.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILE1 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-30'
        FILE2 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-31'
        CTM_PLOTRATIO, 'IJ-AVG-$', $

 NAME:
        CTM_PRINTDIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Prints the sum of the differences between two CTM
        output files.  This is a quick way of ensuring that
        two model versions are producing identical results.

 CATEGORY:

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: "IJ-AVG-$").        

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file (the "old" file).
             If FILE1 is not given, or if it contains wildcard 
             characters (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted

 NAME:
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO

 PURPOSE:
        Create and print a formatted list of DATAINFO records.
        This procedure can be used for direct printing, but it
        can also return a string array of the formatted output 
        e.g. for use in a widget list.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO,DATAINFO [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> One or more DATAINFO records, e.g. the result 
             from CTM_GET_DATA.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FIELDS -> (*** not yet implemented ***) A list of fields
             (structure tag names) to be printed. Default is
             CATEGORY, ILUN, TRACERNAME, TRACERNUMBER, 
             UNIT, TAU0, STATUS, DIMENSIONS
             FIELDS can also include tags from the (global) FILEINFO
             structure (e.g. FILENAME).

        OUTPUT -> A named variable that will contain a string array
             with the formatted output including the title line but 
             without the seperating lines. The title is not included
             if keyword /NOTITLE is set.

        /NOPRINT -> Don't print, only return formatted strings

        /NOTITLE -> Do not generate title line (will neither be printed
             nor included in OUTPUT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External subroutines required:  
        ------------------------------
        GAMAP_CMN  (include file)
        TAU2YYMMDD (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        For GISS, FSU family of models, TAU0 = 0 occurs on date 1/1/1980.
        For GEOS      family of models, TAU0 = 0 occurs on date 1/1/1985.
        Therefore, the model family must be obtained from the global
        FILEINFO structure in order to display the YYMMDD
        corresponding to TAU0.
 
 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_GET_DATA,DataInfo,File='',tracer=2
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO,DataInfo
        ; *or*

 NAME:
        CTM_READ3DB_HEADER

 PURPOSE:
        retrieve header information and file positions of data
        blocks from binary global 3D model output. This is a
        twin of CTM_READ3DP_HEADER which digests the header
        information from ASCII punch files.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        test = CTM_READ3DB_HEADER(LUN,FILEINFO,DATAINFO [,keywords])

 INPUTS:
        LUN --> logical file unit of the binary punch file. The file 
             must be open (see CTM_OPEN_FILE or OPEN_FILE)

        FILEINFO --> a (single) fileinfo structure containing information
             about the (open) file (see CREATE3DFSTRU). FILEINFO also
             contains information about the model which generated
             the output (see CTM_TYPE)

        DATAINFO --> a named variable that will contain an array of
             structures describing the file content (see
             CREATE3DHSTRU)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        PRINT  -> if activated, print all headers found in the file

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns 1 if successful, and 0 otherwise. 

        FILEINFO --> toptitle and modelinfo tags will be set

        DATAINFO --> contains an array of named structures 
             (see CREATE3DHSTRU) with all relevant information
             from the punch file header and what is needed to find
             and load the data.
              
 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses CREATE3DHSTRU function to create header structure
        uses CHKSTRU to test FILEINFO structure
        uses CTM_TYPE to create modelinfo structure
        needs gamap_cmn.pro to access global common block

 NOTES:
        This routine uses the new binary file format introduced
        first to the GEOS/Harvard CTM.

 EXAMPLE:
              fileinfo = create3dfstru()   ; not required !
              fname = '~bmy/terra/CTM4/results/ctm.bpch'
              open_file,fname,ilun,/F77_UNFORMATTED   ; <=== !!
              if (ilun gt 0) then $
                 result = CTM_READ3DB_HEADER(ilun,fileinfo,datainfo)
              print,result

        To get e.g. all scaling factors, type 
              print,datainfo[*].scale

        To retrieve the header structure for one data block, type
              blocki = datainfo[i]

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

                            records were never added as they were 
                            supposed to.
        bmy, 26 Jul 1999: - also print out SKIP field in debug output
        bmy, 10 Jul 2003: GAMAP VERSION 1.53
                          - added kludge so that GEOS-3 reduced grid
                            w/ 30 layers will be added to FILEINFO
                            correctly

                          - removed kludge for GEOS3_30L, since the
                            bug in CTM_TYPE has now been fixed
        bmy, 24 Aug 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - now assign FORMAT string for Filetype 105
                            which is BPCH file for GEOS-CHEM station
                            timeseries (e.g. ND48 diagnostic)
  phs & bmy, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Now account for FILETYPE=106, which

 NAME:
        CTM_READ3DP_HEADER

 PURPOSE:
        retrieve header information and file positions of data
        blocks from global 3D model punch file output.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        test = CTM_READ3DP_HEADER(LUN,FILEINFO,DATAINFO [,keywords])

 INPUTS:
        LUN --> logical file unit of the punch file. The file
             must be open (see CTM_OPEN_FILE or OPEN_FILE)

        FILEINFO --> a (single) fileinfo structure containing information
             about the (open) file (see CREATE3DFSTRU). FILEINFO also
             contains information about the model that generated the
             data, which is queried interactively.

        DATAINFO --> a named variable that will contain an array of
             structures describing the file content (see
             CREATE3DHSTRU)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /NO_TOPTITLE --> do not interprete first line of file as
             header line. Only one header line will be skipped
             (as normally only one header line is read in).

        /EXTRA_SPACE -> digests output from GISS_II_PRIME model with
             extra spaces in the punch file. This keyword is optional
             in the following sense: If CTM_READ3DP_HEADER detects
             an error reading a header line, it is called again
             automatically with this option set.

        PRINT  -> if activated, print all headers found in the file

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns 1 if successful, and 0 otherwise.

        FILEINFO --> toptitle and modelinfo tags will be set

        DATAINFO --> contains an array of named structures
             (see CREATE3DHSTRU) with all relevant information
             from the punch file header and what is needed to find
             and load the data.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses CREATE3DHSTRU function to create header structure
        uses CHKSTRU to test FILEINFO structure
        uses CTM_TYPE to set modelinfo
        needs gamap_cmn.pro to set default in query for model type

 NOTES:
        This routine does rely on the output format from the global GCM
        as specified first for the GEOS/Harvard CTM. However, it is
        designed to digest the output from all models currently used
        in DJJ's group.
        It uses the NL parameter to skip blocks between headers.

        The window offsets (I0, J0, L0) are set to
        zero, since the ASCII punch file is not set up to save
        a sub-region of the globe (bmy, 2/11/99)

 EXAMPLE:
              fileinfo = create3dfstru()   ; not required !
              fname = '~bmy/terra/CTM4/results/ctm.pch.m2'
              open_file,fname,ilun
              if (ilun gt 0) then $
                 result = ctm_read3dp_header(ilun,fileinfo,datainfo)
              print,result

        To get e.g. all scaling factors, type
              print,datainfo[*].scale

        To retrieve the header structure for one data block, type
              blocki = datainfo[i]

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 21 Aug 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 02 Mar 1998: VERSION 1.10
                  - can handle GEOS output now
                  - reads in file header
                  - returns structure instead of string array
                  - always returns all entries, filtering must be done later
        mgs, 03 Mar 1998: - now returns a structure and is a function
        mgs, 04 Mar 1998: - toptitle is now default, changed keyword to
                    NO_TOPTITLE ; eliminated search for '!' or '%'
        mgs, 10 Mar 1998: - rewritten again, now with named structure
                    returned as DATAINFO. Skipping of data blocks
                    drastically improved by setting the file pointer
                    instead of reading the lines.
        mgs, 16 May 1998: - removed DATATYPE3DP function, set type tag to -1
                  - added EXTRA_SPACE option for GISS_II_PRIME output and
                    LINELENGTH keyword for full flexibility
                  - now ignores time series ('TS...') data
        mgs, 13 Aug 1998: - format string now composed here, not in
                    read3dp_data
        mgs, 14 Aug 1998: VERSION 2.00 - major changes!
                  - now requires open file and uses ILUN parameter
                  - automatic EXTRA_SPACE detection
                  - fileinfo structure not created any more, and only
                    extended if present (chkstru)
                  - error messages as dialog box
                  - LINELENGTH keyword removed
        mgs, 15 Aug 1998: - now calls select_model and inserts model
                    information in fileinfo structure
                  - gamap_cmn.pro included for default model name
                  - had to change DEBUG keyword into PRINT
        mgs, 21 Sep 1998: - changed gamap.cmn to gamap_cmn.pro
        mgs, 26 Oct 1998: - now resets error state in no_dim
        mgs, 14 Jan 1998: - new lcount for line counting in error report
                  - linelength adjusted for working in Windows (CR/LF)
        bmy, 11 Feb 1999: VERSION 2.01
                  - Add window offsets (I0,J0,L0) to DATAINFO 
                  - save DATAINFO.TAU0 and DATAINFO.TAU1 as double precision
        bmy, 17 Feb 1999: VERSION 2.02
                  - changed to accommodate the FIRST field (instead of OFFSET)
                    of the DATAINFO structure, which contains
                    the I, J, L indices of the first grid box
        bmy, 01 Mar 1999: 
                  - bug fix!  NL needs to be a longword, so that
                    we can read 2 x 2.5 punch files correctly!! 
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: 
                  - cleaned up reading of dimensions from label a little
        mgs, 27 May 1999: 
                  - new default number of records is 512 instead of 4096.
                  - bug fix: new records were never appended.
        mgs, 22 Jun 1999: 
                  - bug fix: "title" needed to be trimmed.
        bmy, 20 Jan 2000: FOR GAMAP VERSION 1.44
                  - !ERR is now replaced by !ERROR_STATE.CODE
                  - !ERR_STRING is now replaced by !ERROR_STATE.MSG
                  - I/O error trapping is now done by testing error
                    messages instead of testing for error numbers
                  - cosmetic changes, updated comments

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data blocks from a COARDS-compliant netCDF file (such
        as created by routine BPCH2COARDS) into GAMAP.  CTM_READ_COARDS 
        is is an internal routine which is called by CTM_OPEN_FILE.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_READ_COARDS, [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        ILUN -> GAMAP file unit which will denote the netCDF file.

        FILENAME -> Name of the netCDF grid file to be read.
 
        FILEINFO -> Array of FILEINFO structures which will be
             returned to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will 
             append FILEINFO to the GAMAP global common block.

        DATAINFO -> Array of DATAINFO structures (each element 
             specifies a GAMAP data block) which will be returned
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO 
             to the GAMAP global common block.        

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ====================================================
        CRC_Get_DimInfo        CRC_Get_IndexVars   
        CRC_Read_Global_Atts   CRC_Get_Tracer
        CRC_Get_Data           CRC_Save_Data

        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================================
        CTM_GRID          (function)   CTM_TYPE (function)
        CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO (function)   STRRIGHT (function)
        STRREPL           (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) Assumes that data blocks have the following dimensions:
            (a) longitude, latitude, time  
            (b) longitude, latitude, levels, time

        (2) Assumes that times are given in GMT.

        (3) If information about each tracer in the COARDS-compliant
            netCDF file is stored in the GAMAP "tracerinfo.dat" file, 
            then CTM_READ_COARDS will be able to read the file without 
            having to ask the user to supply a GAMAP category and
            tracer name.  
       
 EXAMPLE:
        ILUN     = 21
        FILENAME = 'coards.20010101.nc'
        CTM_READ_COARDS, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO

             ; Reads data from the COARDS-compliant netCDF file 
             ; coards.20010101.nc and stores it the FILEINFO and 
             ; DATAINFO arrays of structures.  If you are calling 
             ; CTM_READ_COARDS from CTM_OPEN_FILE, then CTM_OPEN_FILE 
             ; will append FILEINFO and DATAINFO to the GAMAP global
             ; common block.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 21 Mar 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
        bmy, 21 Jul 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - bug fix in CRC_SAVE_DATA
        bmy, 06 Mar 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.05
                          - minor bug fix in CRC_READ_GLOBAL_ATTS
                          - bug fix in CRC_SAVE_DATA: add a fake 4th
                            dim to DATA array if needed
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
        bmy, 16 Sep 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Convert some global attributes to number
                            types in case attributes were initially
                            saved to the netCDF file as strings
        phs, 15 Sep 2009: - Added check on reading tracerinfo.dat
                          - Convert some tracer names created by
                            BPCH2COARDS to their original value.
        bmy, 14 Dec 2011: GAMAP VERSION 2.16
                          - Updated to read the GAMAP category value
                            from a netCDF variable attribute (if present)
        bmy, 19 Dec 2011: - Generalized to handle several different
                            vertical levels
        bmy, 21 Dec 2011: - Now will interpret netCDF attributes
                            "begin_date" and "begin_time" in the same
                            way as "start_date" and "start_time"
        bmy, 22 Dec 2011: - Now compute FIRST (nested datablock offsets)
                            properly for nested grids.  For now assume
                            that the data will always start on the first
                            vertical level.
                          - Bug fix: test for Latrev gt 0 to avoid
                            INADVERTENTLY reversing latitudes
        bmy, 03 Jan 2012: - Skip over Ap and Bp index arrays
                          - Now use better error checks for
                            the time and vertical level dimensions
                            for each tracer in the netCDF file.
        bmy, 05 Jan 2012: - Now interpret DELTA_TIME attribute
                            correctly when specified in hhmmss format.
        bmy, 10 Jan 2012: - Fix to interpret data blocks with multiple 
                            vertical dimensions in the same file 
        bmy, 13 Jan 2012: - When the time dimension in the netCDF
                            file is 1 (esp. when time is an UNLIMITED
                            variable, we need to add a fake dimension
                            of 1 back onto the data block to avoid
                            crashes.  This is a quirk in how the IDL
                            NCDF_VARGET function works.
        bmy, 23 Jan 2017: GAMAP VERSION 2.19
                          - Add modifications to read netCDF restart files

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_DATA

 PURPOSE:
        read in one data block from a global model punch file output
        (ASCII or binary)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_READ_DATA,data,datainfo
        or:
        CTM_READ_DATA,data,ilun,filepos,xsize,ysize[,zsize,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> a datainfo structure as retrieved from
             CTM_OPEN_FILE. This is the easiest way to read 3D
             model output. Alternatively, the individual parameters
             can be specified as follows.
             
        ILUN  -> logical file unit of input file (must be opened before)
        FILEPOS -> a long word containing the start position of the data
             block to be read (normally retrieved by CTM_OPEN_FILE)
        XSIZE -> 1st dimension of the data array
        YSIZE -> 2nd dimension of the data array
        ZSIZE -> optional 3rd dimension of the data array

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        Note: These keywords are ineffective when parameters are passed
        via the DATAINFO structure!

        SCALE -> apply scaling factor to data (default = 1.0)

        FORMAT -> string with format identifier for data block
             Default is '(12f6.2)'. Use '(8e10.3)' for BUDGETS output and
             '(12(f6.2,1x))' for "extra_space" output. Format='BINARY'
             indicates a binary file with REAL*4 data. (As long as the
             dimensions are specified correctly ANY binary file can
             be read this way, i.e. there is no need for additional 
             routines to read in e.g. gridded emission data files)

        RESULT -> will return 1 if successful, 0 otherwise

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA  -> a float array containing the block of data which is 
             either a 2D or a 3D array.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        file must have been opened and file positions of the data block
        must be known (see CTM_OPEN_FILE)

 NOTES:
        The data array is *not* added to the datainfo structure! 

 EXAMPLE:
        ; Open a punch file interactively
        CTM_OPEN_FILE,'',fileinfo,datainfo

        ; Test if successful
        IF (not chkstru(datainfo)) then return

        ; Read in data of first data block
        CTM_READ_DATA,data,datainfo[0]

        ; This is equivalent to:
        CTM_READ_DATA,data,fileinfo.ilun,datainfo[0].filepos, $
             datainfo[0].dim[0],datainfo[0].dim[1],datainfo[0].dim[2], $
             scale=datainfo[0].scale,format=datainfo[0].format

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 13 Aug 1998: VERSION 1.00 (from CTM_READ3DP_DATA)
                          - replaced EFORMAT keyword by more flexible 
                            FORMAT keyword (involves changes in 
                            CTM_READ3DP_HEADER and CREATE_3DHSTRU)
        mgs, 17 Aug 1998: VERSION 2.00
                          - now possible to pass DATAINFO structure
                          - made it necessary to place DATA argument 
                            as first parameter
        mgs, 19 Aug 1998: - added RESULT keyword
        mgs, 26 Oct 1998: - changed print statements to message
                          - user is now prompted when dimensions 
                            are not given
        bmy, 07 Apr 2000: - Added DAO keyword for reading in DAO met fields
        bmy, 11 Apr 2001: - now uses DATA = TEMPORARY( DATA ) * SCALE[0]
                            in order to prevent excess memory usage
        bmy, 19 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                          - Removed GMAO keyword, we now use the
                            FORMAT string to test for GMAO data files
  phs & bmy, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data blocks from a HDF-EOS Grid file into GAMAP.
        (This is an internal routine which is called by CTM_OPEN_FILE.)
        
 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_READ_EOSGR, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO, [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        ILUN -> GAMAP file unit which will denote the HDF-EOS file.

        FILENAME -> Name of the HDF-EOS grid file to be read.
 
        FILEINFO -> Array of FILEINFO structures which will be
             returned to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will 
             append FILEINFO to the GAMAP global common block.

        DATAINFO -> Array of DATAINFO structures (each element 
             specifies a GAMAP data block) which will be returned
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        =====================================================
        CRE_Get_DimInfo   CRE_Get_TracerInfo   CRE_Save_Data

        External Subroutines Required:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) Currently is set up to read HDF-EOS files containing
            GMAO met data files.  You must have all possible met
            field names listed in your "tracerinfo.dat" file or 
            else you will get an "Invalid Selection" error.
                
 EXAMPLE:
        ILUN     = 21
        FILENAME = 'a_llk_03.tsyn2d_mis_x.t20030801'
        CTM_READ_EOSGR, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO

             ; Reads data from HDF-EOS file a_llk_03.tsyn2d_mis_x.t20030801
             ; and stores it the FILEINFO and DATAINFO arrays of
             ; structures.  If calling CTM_READ_GMI from CTM_OPEN_FILE,
             ; then CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO and DATAINFO
             ; to the GAMAP common block.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 12 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_GMAO

 PURPOSE:
        Reads GMAO I-6,(instantaneous 6h), A-6 (average 6h),
        or A-3 (average 3-h) met field files, and constructs
        a DATAINFO structure for each met field.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals
 
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Result = CTM_READ_GMAO( Ilun, FileInfo, DataInfo [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        ILUN --> The name of the input file (or a file mask).
             FILENAME is passed to OPEN_FILE.  If FILENAME is a null 
             string or a file mask, then OPEN_FILE will open a
             pickfile dialog box.

        FILEINFO --> a (single) fileinfo structure containing information
             about the (open) file (see CREATE3DFSTRU). FILEINFO also
             contains information about the model which generated
             the output (see CTM_TYPE)

        DATAINFO --> a named variable that will contain an array of
             structures describing the file content (see
             CREATE3DHSTRU)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        PRINT  -> if activated, print all headers found in the file

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns 1 if successful, and 0 otherwise. 

        FILEINFO --> toptitle and modelinfo tags will be set

        DATAINFO --> contains an array of named structures 
             (see CREATE3DHSTRU) with all relevant information
             from the punch file header and what is needed to find
             and load the data.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ================================================
        CRG_GET_MODELINFO

        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================================
        CHKSTRU  (function)     CTM_GRID      (function)
        CTM_TYPE (function)     CREATE3DHSTRU (function)
        

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) You must also add additional met field names to your
        "tracerinfo.dat" file as is neccesary.  CTM_READ_GMAO looks
        up met fields stored under the GAMAP categories "GMAO-2D"
        and "GMAO-3D$".

        (2) GEOS-4 met field files have an 8-char ident string 
        of the format "G4 45 19", where:

           (a) "G4" means that it is a GEOS-4 met field file/
           (b) "45" is the resolution code (in this case 4x5).
           (c) "19" is the number of met fields stored w/in the file.

        CTM_READ_GMAO will now set the modeltype and resolution from
        the information in this ident string.  For older met field 
        types (e.g. GEOS-3) which do not have this ident string,
        CTM_READ_GMAO will determine the modeltype and resolution 
        from the filename and date.

 EXAMPLES:
        FileInfo = CREATE3DFSTRU()   ; not required !
        FName    = '/r/amalthea/N/scratch/bmy/960101.a3.4x5'
        OPEN_FILE, FName, Ilun, /F77_Unformatted   
        if ( Ilun gt 0 ) $
            then Result = CTM_READ_GMAO( Ilun, FileInfo, DataInfo )
        print,result

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_GMI

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data blocks from a GMI netCDF file into GAMAP.
        (This is an internal routine called from CTM_OPEN_FILE.)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_READ_GMI, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO, [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        ILUN -> GAMAP file unit which will denote the GMI netCDF file.

        FILENAME -> Name of the GMI netCDF grid file to be read.
 
        FILEINFO -> Array of FILEINFO structures which will be
             returned to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will 
             append FILEINFO to the GAMAP global common block.

        DATAINFO -> Array of DATAINFO structures (each element 
             specifies a GAMAP data block) which will be returned
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO 
             to the GAMAP global common block.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords
 
 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ===============================================
        CRG_Debug_Print   CRG_Get_Name   CRG_Get_Tau0       
        CRG_Get_Tracer    CRG_Get_Data   CRG_Save_Data

        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================================
        CTM_GRID (function)   CTM_TYPE (function)
        NCDF_GET (function)   TVMAP

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) Currently is hardwired to reading in data blocks 
            from netCDF files created for the GMI comparison
            study.  It is difficult to create a general netCDF
            reader since there are many different ways to store
            data w/ in a netCDF file.

 EXAMPLE:
        ILUN     = 21
        FILENAME = 'gmit4_maccm3_year_CO.nc'
        CTM_READ_GMI, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO

             ; Reads data from the netCDF file gmit4_maccm3_year_CO.nc
             ; and stores it the FILEINFO and DATAINFO arrays of
             ; structures.  If calling CTM_READ_GMI from CTM_OPEN_FILE,
             ; then CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO and DATAINFO
             ; to the GAMAP common block.

             stuctures to select from. Unlike the higher level routines,
             CTM_READ_MULTILEVEL does not provide default values for 
             these! 

        RESULT -> A named variable that will be 1 if successful, 
             0 otherwise.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) Currently assumes that the netCDF file was written
            by GAMAP routine BPCH2NC.

 EXAMPLE:
        ILUN     = 21
        FILENAME = 'geos.20010101.nc'
        CTM_READ_NCDF, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO

             ; Reads data from the netCDF file geos.20010101.nc
             ; and stores it the FILEINFO and DATAINFO arrays of
             ; structures.  If calling CTM_READ_GMI from CTM_OPEN_FILE,
             ; then CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO and DATAINFO
             ; to the GAMAP common block.

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT

 PURPOSE:
        Reads GEOS-CHEM plane flight diagnostic (ND40) data.  

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT( FILENAME )

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file containing data from the GEOS-CHEM
             plane following diagnostic ND40.  If FILENAME is omitted,
             then a dialog box will prompt the user to supply a file name.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Array of structures containing data from read from
             the input file.  Each different plane type will have 
             a structure in RESULT containing the following tags:
 
             NPOINTS  : Number of points read from the file 
             NVARS    : Number of variables read from the file
             PLATFORM : Name of plane type (e.g. DC8, P3B, FALCON)
             DATE     : Array w/ YYYYMMDD  at each flight point [GMT date]
             TIME     : Array w  HHMM      at each flight point [GMT time]
             LAT      : Array w/ latitude  at each flight point [degrees ]
             LON      : Array w/ longitude at each flight point [degrees ]   
             PRESS    : Array w/ pressure  at each flight point [hPa     ]
             VARNAMES : Array w/ names of each variable 
             DATA     : Array w/ data for each variable

 SUBROUTINES:

        External Subroutines Required:
        ==========================================
        OPEN_FILE   STRBREAK (function)  UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        We read the data into arrays first, and then save the arrays
        into an IDL structure.  If you read the data into an array of
        structures, this executes much more slowly.  Also arrays of
        structures seem to suck up an inordinate amount of memory.

 EXAMPLES:
        PLANEINFO = CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT( 'plane.log.20040601' )
             ; Reads data from file into the PLANEINFO structure

        DC8 = WHERE( PLANEINFO[*].PLATFORM eq 'DC801' )
             ; Look for DC8 data

        PRINT, PLANEINFO[DC8].LAT[*]
        PRINT, PLANEINFO[DC8].LON[*]
             ; Prints latitudes and longitudes of DC8 to the screen

        IND = WHERE( PLANEINFO[DC8].VARNAMES eq 'TRA_004' )
        CO  = PLANEINFO[DC8].DATA[ *, IND ]
             ; Extracts CO (tracer #4 in a GEOS-CHEM fullchem
             ; simulation) to an array

        IND  = WHERE( PLANEINFO[DC8].VARNAMES eq 'GMAO_UWND' )
        UWND = PLANEINFO[DC8].DATA[ *, IND ]
             ; Extracts U-wind information to an array

 NAME:
        CTM_REGRIDH

 PURPOSE:
        Regrids data horizontally from one CTM grid to another, 
        for both cases:

           (1) fine grid    -->  coarse grid  OR
           (2) coarse grid  -->  fine grid

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NEWDATA = CTM_REGRIDH( DATA, OLDGRID, NEWGRID [ , Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> a 2-D or 3-D data field to be regridded.  DATA can be
             either in single-precision or double-precision.  

        OLDGRID, NEWGRID -> GRIDINFO structures (use "ctm_grid.pro" 
             to create one) defining the old and new grids.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DOUBLE -> If set, will return NEWDATA as a double-precision
             array.  Default is to return NEWDATA as a floating-point
             single-precision array.

        /PER_UNIT_AREA -> Set this switch if the quantity you want to
             regrid is per unit area or per unit volume (i.e. molec/cm2, 
             molec/cm3, kg/m2, etc.).  CTM_REGRIDH will multiply by
             the input grid's surface areas, so as to convert it to
             an area-independent quantity for regridding.  After the 
             regridding, CTM_REGRIDH will then divide the quantity
             by the surface areas on the new grid.  

        /USE_SAVED_WEIGHTS -> If set, will use the mapping weights
             saved by a prior call to CTM_REGRIDH.  This is useful
             if you are regridding 3-D data, thus CTM_REGRIDH can be
             told only to compute the mapping weights for the first
             level, thus saving processing time.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, will echo informational messages to the
             screen during the regridding process.  Totals on both
             old and new grids will also be printed.

        WFILE -> Name of the file with pre-saved mapping weights from
             the old grid to the new grid (created by CTM_GETWEIGHT).
             If WFILE is not specified, then CTM_REGRIDH will compute 
             the mapping weights on the fly.  These weights will be
             returned to the calling program via the WEIGHT keyword
             for use on subsequent calls to CTM_REGRIDH.  

 OUTPUTS:
        NEWDATA -> a 2-D or 3-D array containing the regridded data.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines Included:
        =================================================
        CRH_GETWEIGHT 

        External Subroutines Required:
        =================================================
        CHKSTRU  (function)   CTM_BOXSIZE (function)   
        CTM_GETWEIGHT         UNDEFINE
       
 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_REGRIDH now supersedes CTM_REGRID.  The old
            CTM_REGRID program worked fine, but could only 
            go from fine grids to coarse grids.

        (2) Assumes that you are passing globally-sized arrays.
            If you have less than global-sized data, then you 
            must add that data to a globally sized array, and
            then call CTM_REGRIDH.    

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)

        ; Define old grid
        OLDTYPE    = CTM_TYPE( 'GENERIC',    RES=[1,1], $
                                HALFPOLAR=0, CENTER180=0 )
        OLDGRID    = CTM_GRID( OLDTYPE )

        ; Define new grid
        NEWTYPE    = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS_STRAT', RES=4 )
        NEWGRID    = CTM_GRID( NEWTYPE )

        ; Regrid data
        NEWDATA = CTM_REGRIDH( DATA, OLDGRID, NEWGRID, $
                               /PER_UNIT_AREA, /VERBOSE )

             ; Regrids a quantity such as fossil fuel emissions 
             ; in [molec/cm2/s] from the generic 1 x 1 emissions
             ; grid to GEOS-STRAT 4 x 5 resolution.  Message info 
             ; will be echoed to the screen during the regridding.
             ; The mapping weights from OLDGRID to NEWGRID will
             ; be computed by CTM_REGRIDH and stored internally
             ; for possible future use.  

        (2)

        ; Define old grid
        OLDTYPE  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS_STRAT', RES=2 )
        OLDGRID  = CTM_GRID( OLDTYPE )

        ; Define new grid
        NEWTYPE  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS_STRAT', RES=4 )
        NEWGRID  = CTM_GRID( NEWTYPE )

        ; Regrid first data array, read mapping weights from disk
        NEWDATA1 = CTM_REGRIDH( DATA1, OLDGRID, NEWGRID, $
                                WFILE='weights_generic1x1_geos4x5.dat' )

        ; Regrid second data array, use weights from prior call
        NEWDATA2 = CTM_REGRIDH( DATA2, OLDGRID, NEWGRID, $
                               /USE_SAVED_WEIGHTS )

             ; Regrids quantities such as air mass in [kg] from
             ; 2 x 2.5 resolution to 4 x 5 resolution for the
             ; GEOS-STRAT grid.  Since WFILE is specified,
             ; will read the mapping weights between OLDGRID and 
             ; from a file on disk instead of having to compute
             ; them online.  These mapping weights will then be
             ; saved internally for possible future use.
             ;
             ; Note that you can specify that you want to use the
             ; pre-saved with the /USE_SAVED_WEIGHTS flag.  This 
             ; prevents CTM_REGRIDH from having to re-read the 
             ; mapping weights all over again -- a real timesaver.

 NAME:
        CTM_RESTART_O3

 PURPOSE:
        Merges single-tracer Ox data into a full-chemistry
        CTM restart file.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_RESTART_O3 [, BATCHFILE [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        BATCHFILE (optional) -> Name of the input file containing
             the names of the full chemistry restart file, the
             single tracer O3 file, the annual mean tropopause file,
             and the output file.  If BATCHFILE is omitted, then the
             user will be prompted to make a selection via a dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /STRAT_ONLY -> Set this keyword to only merge the stratospheric
             Ox into the full chemistry restart file.  Stratospheric 
             levels are determined by reading in the annual mean 
             tropopause file (as specified in BATCHFILE).  Default is
             to merge all levels into the full chemistry restart file.

 OUTPUTS:
        Will write merged data to an output file whose name is
        specified in BATCHFILE.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External subroutines required:
        ------------------------------------------------------
        CTM_GRID     (function)  CTM_GET_DATABLOCK (function)
        CTM_GET_DATA             OPEN_FILE
        STR2BYTE     (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        CTM_RESTART_O3 is currently only applicable to the GEOS-CTM,
        since this is the only model that can run single tracer Ox.

        A Sample BATCHFILE is given below.  There must be 3 header 
        lines before the first file name:

CTM_RESTART_O3.DAT -- defines filenames to read in for merging single 
                      tracer Ox data into a full chem restart file

 NAME:
        CTM_RETRIEVE_DATA

 PURPOSE:
        Read one "compound" data block from disk. The datainfo
        parameter must contain only one entry, and it must have
        status=0. The data pointer is assumed to be NULL.
        If requested data block is a multilevel or multitracer 
        diagnostics, the routine will search all individual data 
        records that belong to that block and loop over them
        (this is actually done in ctm_read_multilevel and 
        ctm_read_multitracer).

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

                  result=result

 INPUTS:
        DataInfo -> DataInfo structure that is to hold the data.
            Normally, this is either created in CTM_GET_DATA for
            multilevel or multitracer diagnostics, or it is created
            upon parsing the header information (ctm_read3d?_header).

        DIAGSTRU -> A (single) diagnostic structure containing
            information what to load (see CTM_DIAGINFO)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        USE_DATAINFO, USE_FILEINFO -> The array of Datainfo and Fileinfo
             stuctures to select from. Unlike the higher level routines,
             CTM_READ_MULTILEVEL does not provide default values for
             these!

        RESULT -> A named variable that will be 1 if successful,
             0 otherwise.

 OUTPUTS:
        The DATAINFO structure will contain the correct dimensional
        information, the status will be set to 1, and the data pointer
        points to a 2D or 3D data array. (if reading was successful)

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses CTM_DOSELECT_DATA, CTM_READ_MULTILEVEL, 
             CTM_READ_MULTITRACER, CTM_READ_DATA,
             gamap_cmn.pro

 NOTES:
        This routine is meant for internal use from CTM_GET_DATA.

 NAME:
        CTM_SELECT_DATA (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Provide a user-friendly function to extract data
        from a DATAINFO structure. The function returns an 
        index to the given DATAINFO structure which points
        to all recored that fulfill the specified conditions.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(DIAGN[,DATAINFO,keywords])

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name. Only one
            diagnostic can be extracted at the same time. Complete
            information about the requested diagnostic is returned 
            via the DIAGSTRU keyword. (see also CTM_DIAGINFO)

        DATAINFO -> An [optional] subset of the global DataInfo
            structure. As default, CTM_SELECT_DATA operates on
            the global DATAINFO structure (see gamap_cmn.pro) scanning
            all files that have been opened.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ILUN -> A logical unit value or an array of logical unit
            values. Only recored from these files will be returned.
            Default is to use all files.
            A link between logical unit numbers and filenames can be
            made through the (global) FileInfo structure (see gamap_cmn.pro)

        TRACER -> A tracer number or an array of tracer numbers to
            restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all tracers. 
            Tracer numbers less than 100 are automatically expanded
            to include the offset of certain diagnostics (see
            CTM_DIAGINFO and CTM_DOSELECT_DATA).

        TAU -> A time value (tau0 !) or an array of time values
            to restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all time steps. (see also example)

        LEVELRANGE -> A 1 or 2 element vector with a level index or 
            a range of level indices for multilevel diagnostics
            (e.g. 'IJ-AVG$'). As default, information is returned
            about full 3D data blocks only. See also 
            EXPAND keyword.

        /EXPAND -> If set, multilevel diagnostic fields are
            expanded to return the individual layers in addition to
            the complete 3D cube.
        
        DATA -> A named variable that will contain an array with
            pointers to the indexed data blocks. Note that some may
            be NIL pointers if the STATUS value is 0 or 2.

        COUNT -> A named variable that will return the number of
            data blocks found with the given selection criteria
 
        DIAGSTRU -> A named variable that will contain complete 
            information about the requested diagnostics (see
            CTM_DIAGINFO)

        STATUS -> Restricts the data selection to
            Data that has not been read  (STATUS = 0)
            Data that has been read      (STATUS = 1, default)
            All data blocks              (STATUS = 2)
            If STATUS is 1, all pointers returned in DATA are valid.

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns an (long) integer array that contains
        index values to all the data blocks that match the selection 
        criteria. If no data is found, -1 is returned.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses CTM_DOSELECT_DATA, EXPAND_CATEGORY, gamap_cmn.pro,
             GAMAP_INIT, CTM_DIAGINFO

 NOTES:
        This function acts for the most part as a convenient user
        interface to CTM_DOSELECT_DATA which performs the actual
        selection process and contains only minimal error checking.
        For programming purposes, use CTM_DOSELECT_DATA when possible.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; open a CTM punch file
        CTM_OPEN_FILE

        ; Read diagnostic number 45 for all tracers and time steps
        CTM_READ_DATA,45

        ; Select data for tracer 1 and diagnostics 45 
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(45,tracer=1,data=pdata)

        ; De-reference the data pointer for the first record
        ; (usually the first timestep)
        if (index[0] ge 0) then data = (*pdata)[0] 

        ; find data for a specific time range
        DataInfo = (*pGlobalDataInfo)[index]
        taus = where(DataInfo.tau0 ge 77666L AND DataInfo.tau1 le 78888L)
        taus = DataInfo.tau0[taus]
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(45,DataInfo,tracer=1,tau=taus,data=pdata)
        

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 19 Aug 1998: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 21 Sep 1998: - changed gamap.cmn to gamap_cmn.pro
        mgs, 07 Oct 1998: - removed obsolete FILEINFO parameter
                          - changed NO_EXPAND to EXPAND
        bmy, 19 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                          - Now get spacing between diagnostic offsets
                            from CTM_DIAGINFO and pass to CTM_DOSELECT_DATA
                          - Now use the /NO_DELETE keyword in the
                            call to routine EXPAND_CATEGORY

 NAME:
        CTM_SUM

 PURPOSE:
        Calculate the sum of several CTM output data blocks
        and store them in a new datainfo structure as "derived 
        data".  The user can select data blocks by diagnostics,
        tracer, tau0, or logical unit of the source file.  With 
        the AVERAGE keyword averages will be computed instead of
        totals.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_SUM [, DIAGN ] [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> The diagnostic category name.  Default is 'IJ-AVG-$'

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) to look for.

        TAU0 -> beginning of time step to look for. You can
            specify a date using function nymd2tau(YYMMDD,HHMMSS)

        ILUN -> If you want to restrict summation to datablocks from
            one particular file, set the ILUN keyword to the 
            respective logical unit number.  ILUN and FILENAME are
            mutually exclusive.  If you select FILENAME then ILUN 
            will be ignored.

        FILENAME -> Instead of ILUN you may pass the name of a
            CTM data file containing data blocks to be summed.
            FILENAME and ILUN are mutually exclusive.  If you 
            select FILENAME then ILUN will be ignored.

        NEWTRACER -> Tracer number for the new tracer. Default is 
            to use the same number as the tracer in the first 
            selected data block.

        NEWTAU0 -> A new pair of values for the time stamp. Default 
            is to use the minimum tau0 and maximum tau1 from the 
            selected data blocks. If only one value is passed (tau0),
            then tau1 will be set to tau0+1.

        /AVERAGE -> set this keyword to compute a (simple) average
            instead of the total.

 OUTPUTS:
        This routne produces no output but stores a new datainfo 
        and fileinfo structure into the global arrays.

 SUBROUTINES:
        uses gamap_cmn, ctm_get_data, ctm_grid, and ctm_make_datainfo

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        All data blocks must originate from compatible models.
        No test can be made whether an identical addition had been
        performed earlier. Hence, it is a good idea to test the
        existence of the "target" record before in order to avoid 
        duplicates.

 EXAMPLE:
        (1) 
        CTM_GET_DATA, DATAINFO, 'IJ-AVG-$', $
          TRACER=1, TAU0=NYMD2TAU( 940301L )

        IF (N_ELEMENTS(DATAINFO) EQ 0) THEN $
           CTM_SUM, 'IJ-AVG-$', TRACER=[1,2,3,4,5],  $
              TAU0=NYMD2TAU(940301L), NEWTRACER=1

           ; Add individual CH3I tracers for 03/01/1994 and 
           ; store them  as total CH3I concentration. 
           ; But first: test!

        (2)
        CTM_SUM,'IJ-AVG-$',$
           TRACER=2, FILENAME='ctm.bpch.ox', /AVERAGE 
        
           ; Compute annual averages from monthly means for Ox

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Added FILENAME keyword as an 
                            alternative to ILUN
                          - Updated comments, cosmetic changes
        phs, 18 Aug 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Added experimental keyword DIMAVER to
                            average along any dimension of the
                            datablocks.

 NAME:
        CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS

 PURPOSE:
        Computes totals of emissions in Tg [or Tg C] for the
        following diagnostics: ND28, ND29, ND32, ND36, ND46, ND13, etc.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS, DIAGN [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name to restrict 
             the record selection (default is "ANTHSRCE").

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Punch file (ASCII or Binary) from which to 
             read CTM emissions data.  If omitted, the user
             will be prompted to select a file via a dialog box.

        FORMAT -> To overwrite the default format to output the
             sum.

        TRACER -> The tracer number (or a 1-D array of tracer
             numbers) to compute emission totals for.

        /CUM_ONLY -> If this switch is set, SUM_EMISSIONS will
             only print out cumuluative totals (and skip individual
             totals for each data block).

        RESULT -> An array of structures (tag names: NAME, SUM, UNIT) 
             that returns, the name of each tracer, its cumulative
             total, and its unit to the calling program.
           
        /NO_SECONDS -> Set this switch if the data to be summed is
             independent of seconds (e.g. molec/cm2).  CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS
             will not multiply the data by the number of seconds in the 
             interval when converting to Tg.

        /KG -> Set this switch if the data to be summed is in kg
             instead of molec/cm2 or molec/cm2/s.  CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS
             will not multiply the data by the surface area of each
             grid box when converting to Tg.

        /TO_Mg -> Set this switch if you wish to display emissions
             totals in Mg instead of Tg.

        /TO_Gg -> Set this switch if you wish to display emissions
             totals in Gg instead of Tg.

        /SHORT -> Use a shorter output format to print totals.
             Default is to print out w/ the long output format.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATA
             or CTM_TRACERINFO.
 
 OUTPUTS:
        Prints totals in Tg or Tg C for each tracer to the screen

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ==================================================
        CSE_GetUnit (function)  CSE_GetAreaCm2 (function)
        CSE_GetInfo

        External Subroutines Required:
        ==================================================

        CTM_GRID    (function)  GAMAP_CMN
        TAU2YYMMDD  (function)  UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Most of the time there will be 1 data block per month,
            and the cumulative total will be a yearly total.

        (2) For NOx, a molecular weight of 14e-3 kg/mole will report
            results in Tg N.  A molecular weight of 46e-3 will report
            results in Tg NOx.  This can be changed in the file
            "tracerinfo.dat".

        (3) Should now be compatible with any model type and grid
            resolution.  As of 6/19/01, has only been tested using
            GEOS-CHEM diagnostic output.

 NAME:
        CTM_TRACERINFO

 PURPOSE:
        Return information about one or all tracers for a given
        GEOS-Chem, GISS, or other CTM diagnostic.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_TRACERINFO, TRACERN, TRACERSTRU [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        TRACERN -> Tracer number or name for which to extract the 
            information. If TRACERN is numeric, it is interpreted as 
            an index to the FULLCHEM or SMALLCHEM tracernumber
            in the global model. If it is a string, it will be compared 
            to NAME then FULLNAME. TRACERN may contain more than one 
            element. To retrieve information about all tracers, use the
            /ALL_TRACERS keyword.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /ALL_TRACERS -> Retrieve information about all tracers

        FILENAME --> Name of the tracerinfo file (default tracerinfo.dat)
            The file will be searched in the current directory first, then
            in the directory where ctm_tracerinfo.pro is located. If not found
            in either location, a standard data block is retrieved from this 
            file.

        /FORCE_READING -> Overwrite the contents of the common block

        FULLNAME -> Returns the (long) name of the requested tracer(s)

        INDEX -> Returns the CTM index of the requested tracer(s)

        MOLC -> Returns the carbon number of the requested tracer(s)
             (For hydrocarbons, this is the # moles C/mole tracer)

        MOLWT -> Returns the molecular weight (kg/mole) of the 
             requested tracer(s)

        NAME -> Returns the (short) name of the requested tracer(s)

        SCALE -> Standard scale factor for tracer

        UNIT -> Returns the standard unit of the requested tracer(s)
             (i.e. unit as supplied by CTM with standard scale factor 
             applied (e.g. ppbv instead of V/V))

        IS_EDGED -> Returns whether the given tracer is defined on
             level edges (IS_EDGED=1) or level centers (IS_EDGED=0).  

 OUTPUTS:
        TRACERSTRU -> returns a structure or structure array with the 
            following tags:
               NAME     : short name for tracer as used in the model
               FULLNAME : long name for tracer (may be used in titles)
               MWT      : molec. weight as kg N or kg C 
               INDEX    : tracer number
               MOLC     : carbon number for NMHC
               SCALE    : standard scale factor
               UNIT     : standard unit for tracer with scale factor applied
               IS_EDGED : Is tracer defined on level edges?

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================================
        FILE_EXIST (function)   ROUTINE_NAME (function)
        OPEN_FILE 
 
 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        At first call, the tracer information structure array is
        either read from file or retrieved from the
        DATA block at the end of this program. Thereafter, the information
        is stored in a common block where it is accessible in subsequent 
        calls.
        The newer tags MOLC, SCALE and UNIT are optional and defaulted
        to 1.0, 1.0, and 'UNDEFINED', resp.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_TRACERINFO, 2, RES
        PRINT, RES.NAME, RES.MWT, RES.INDEX
        ; prints        Ox    0.0480000     2

        CTM_TRACERINFO,'OX',RES
        PRINT, RES.NAME, RES.MWT, RES.INDEX
        ; prints identical results

        CTM_TRACERINFO,[1,3,5],NAME=NAME,MOLWT=MWT,MOLC=MOLC,/FORCE_READING
        PRINT, NAME, MWT, MOLC
        ; reads tracerinfo.dat file and prints

                            to denote whether the tracer is defined
                            on level centers or level edges
                          - Implement temporary fix: call GET_IS_EDGED
                            to determine if a tracer is defined on
                            level edges.  There is probably a better way
                            to do this, work on that later.
                          - Now use FILE_WHICH to locate the
                            "tracerinfo.dat" file.

 NAME:
        CTM_TYPE (function)

 PURPOSE:
        return basic parameters for various 3D models used in
        the Harvard tropospheric modeling group. This information
        should be sufficient for CTM_GRID to compute grid box edge
        and center vectors.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Models & Grids, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MTYPE = CTM_TYPE( NAME [,FAMILY] [,KEYWORDS] )

 INPUTS:
        NAME -> a string containing the name of the model 
             (GISS_II, GISS_II_PRIME (or II_PRIME), GEOS1,
             GEOS_STRAT, FSU, MOPITT, or GENERIC (=DUMMY) )

        FAMILY -> model family (optional, will otherwise be extracted
             from NAME). Possible values: GISS or GEOS or FSU or ''

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NLAYERS -> number of vertical model layers. This number must
             correspond to the number of layers in the model output
             files and is used in conjunction with PTOP to convert
             sigma levels into pressure altitudes.
             [defaults: GEOS1=20, GEOS_STRAT=26, GISS=FSU=9 ]
     
        NTROP -> number of layers in the troposphere
             [defaults: GEOS1=14, GISS=7, FSU=12]

        PTOP -> pressure at model top
             [default 10 mbar except for GEOS_STRAT=0.1 mbar]
     
        PSURF -> average surface pressure (needed for conversion of
             sigma levels to altitudes) [default 984 mbar]
     
        RESOLUTION -> either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 0.5=0.5x0.5)
             [default for all models is 4x5]
     
        HALFPOLAR = (1 | 0) -> indicates that polar boxes span 
             (half | same) latitude as all other boxes (DJ=const.)
             [default: 1]

        HYBRID = (1 | 0) -> indicates that the model is a 
             (sigma-pressure hybrid | pure sigma level ) model.
             [default: 0]

        /PRINT -> prints model parameters on the screen

 OUTPUTS:
        MTYPE -> A structure with the following tag names will be 
             returned:  NAME, FAMILY, NLAYERS, PTOP, PSURF, 
             RESOLUTION, HALFPOLAR, CENTER180, FULLCHEM.  If input 
             parameters are not correct, the function returns -1.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        =====================
        YES_NO_VAL (function)
        CHECK_RESOLUTION

        None

 NOTES:
        If you update this routine by adding additional models, make
        sure to update "select_model.pro" and "getsigma.pro" as well.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        MTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS1', RESOLUTION=2 )

             ; defines model parameters for the GEOS1 model 
             ; at 2 x 2.5 degree resolution.

        (2)
        MTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GISS_II' )
        MGRID = CTM_GRID( MTYPE )

             ; Use CTM_TYPE in conjunction with CTM_GRID to return
             ; the grid structure for the standard GISS_II model.

                            GEOS-5.7.x met data.  (These are
                            identical to the GEOS-5 and MERRA grids,
                            but we will denote them separately).
                          - Added shorthand for 0.25 x 0.3125 resolution

 NAME:
        CTM_WRITEBPCH

 PURPOSE:
        Save GAMAP datainfo records to disk 
        (in binary punch file format).

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_WRITEBPCH, DATAINFO, [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> a datainfo record or an array of datainfo records
 
        FILEINFO -> a fileinfo record or an array of fileinfo records

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Filename of output file. Should end in '.bpch'.

        SCALE -> An optional scaling factor. This factor will be applied 
             to _all_ data record upon saving. The globally stored records
             are not affected.

        NEWUNIT -> With this keyword you can change the unit _name_ for
             the saved data. This will _not_ perform a unit conversion!
             For a true unit conversion you must also use the SCALE
             keyword. NEWUNIT will be applied to _all_ records!

        /APPEND -> If set, then will append to an existing binary
             punch file rather than writing to a new file.

 OUTPUTS:
        A binary punch file with the selected data records will be
        created.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:

 NAME:
        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE

 PURPOSE:
        Defines various customized color tables for use with MYCT.
        Color tables may be stretched to more than the original #
        of colors, or compressed to less than the original # of 
        colors.  You may add more color tables as necessary.

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        %% AS OF GAMAP v2-12, CUSTOM_COLORTABLE IS DEPRECATED.  %%
        %% MYCT NOW LOADS IDL AND ColorBrewer COLORTABLES FROM  %%
        %% THE "gamap_colors.tbl" FILE. (phs, bmy, 4/21/08)     %%
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        
 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, R, G, B [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS
        /BuWhRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-WHITE-RED 
             (diverging) color table from Harvard University.  This
             color table is a concatenation of the WHITE-BLUE and
             WHITE-RED ColorBrewer colortables.  The center color
             is white.  (Original # of colors = 19)

        /BuWhWhRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED 
             (diverging) color table.  This is a concatenation of 
             the WhBu and WhRd colortables from ColorBrewer.  The two
             center colors in this colortable are white, which makes
             it easier to align colorbar tickmarks at the divisions
             between colors.  (Original # of colors = 20)

        /BuYlRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-YELLOW-RED 
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original 
             # of colors = 12)

        /BuYlYlRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED 
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  The two center
             colors in this colortable are light yellow, which makes
             it easier to align colorbar tickmarks at the divisions
             between colors.  Use this colortable instead of /BuWhWhRd 
             if you need to denote "missing data" values by white.  
             (Original # of colors = 12)

        /DIAL -> Set this switch to load the DIAL/LIDAR (diverging)
             color table from Ed Browell. (Original # of colors = 27)

        /DIFF -> Synonym for /BuWhRd.  Kept for backwards compatibility.

        /ModSpec -> Set this switch to load the MODIFIED SPECTRUM
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original #
             of colors = 11)

        NAME -> Returns to the calling program the name of the color
             table that we have selected.

        NCOLORS -> The number of colors that you would like to be
             included in the colortable.  If NCOLORS is greater than
             the native number of colors for the given colortable,
             the colortable will be stretched to produce a finer
             gradation of colors.  Conversely, if NCOLORS is less
             than the native number of colors, then the colortable
             will be compressed to produce a coarser gradation of
             colors.

        /NOLOAD -> If set, then CUSTOM_COLORTABLE will just return R, 
             G, B to the calling program without loading the colortable.

        /TRUNCATE -> When NCOLORS is less than the number of colors
             in the given color table, setting /TRUNCATE will cause 
             CUSTOM_COLORTABLE to truncate the color table to NCOLORS
             rather than trying to compress it via interpolation.

        /UserDef -> Set this switch to load a user-defined colortable.
             In order to use this option, you must first add the R, G,
             B color vectors into internal routine DEFINE_UserDef.

        /WhBu -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-BLUE (spectral)
             color table from ColorBrewer.  (original # of colors = 10)

        /WhGrYlRd -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-GREEN-YELLOW-RED
             (spectral) color table from A. van Donkelaar.  (Original
             # of colors = 20)

        /WhGyBk -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-GRAY-BLACK 
             (spectral) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original # 
             of colors = 10)

        /WhRd -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-RED (spectral) color
             table from ColorBrewer.  (original # of colors = 10)

 OUTPUTS:    
        R -> Returns to the calling program the red color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

        G -> Returns to the calling program the green color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

        B -> Returns to the calling program the blue color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines Included:
        ================================================    
        DEFINE_BuWhRd     DEFINE_BuWhWhRd   DEFINE_BuYlRd   
        DEFINE_BuYlYlRd   DEFINE_DIAL       DEFINE_MODSPEC  
        DEFINE_WhBu       DEFINE_WhGrYlRd   DEFINE_WhRd     
        DEFINE_WhGyBk

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) For contour plots, the native resolution of the
            custom colortables should be sufficient.

        (2) For smoothed pixel plots, NCOLORS=100 or higher will
            eliminate the streaking caused by TVIMAGE's smoothing
            algorithm.

        (3) Some color tables were adapted from the ColorBrewer
            package (see license info below).

        (4) We will use the ColorBrewer color abbreviations:
               Bk = Black    Br = Brown    Bu = Blue      
               Gr = Green    Gy = Gray     Or = Orange    
               Pi = Pink     Pu = Purple   Rd = Red     
               Wh = White    Yl = Yellow

        (5) An MS Excel spreadsheet with all ColorBrewer color tables 
            is available for download from:
            www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/ColorBrewer_RGB.html

 EXAMPLES:

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, R, G, B, /NOLOAD, /DIAL

             ; Returns the red, green, blue color vectors for the
             ; DIAL colortable at native resolution (26 colors)

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, NCOLORS=120, /DIAL

             ; Loads the DIAL colortable and stretches it 
             ; from 26 to 120 colors.

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, /WhGrYlRd

             ; Loads the WHITE-GREEN-YELLOW-RED (spectral) 
             ; color table with 20 colors.
        
 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Adapted from "dial_ct.pro"
                          - Now can compress the colortable if
                            NCOLORS is less than N_ORIG
                          - Added /BuWhWhRd keyword for selecting
                            the BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED colortable
                          - Added /BuYlYlRd keyword for selecting
                            the BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED colortable
                          - /DIFF is now a synonym for /BuWhWhRd
                          - Added /UserDef keyword and internal
                            routine DEFINE_UserDef for selecting
                            a user-defined color table. 
        phs, 12 Feb 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Now create /BuWhRd as a concatenation of
                            the /WhBu and /WhRd colortables.
                          - Updated the interpolation for case of  
                            NCOLORS lt NORIG.  It works fine with all 
                            the 4 diverging colortables, and keeps the 
                            doubling of the middle range color if NCOLORS 
                            is even and BuWhWhRd or BuYlYlRd is used. 
        bmy, 18 Apr 2008: - Bug fix: don't overwrite colortable name
                            for BuWhRd colortable

 NAME:
        DAY_OF_YEAR (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Computes the day number (0-365 or 0-366 if leap year) 
        of a given date.

 CATEGORY:
        Date & Time

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = DAY_OF_YEAR( MONTH, DAY, YEAR )  OR
        RESULT = DAY_OF_YEAR( YYYYMMDD  )

 INPUTS:
        With 3 arguments:
        MONTH (int or long) -> the input month (1 - 12)
        DAY   (int or long) -> the input day   (0 - 31)
        YEAR  (int or long) -> the input year  (YEAR<0 is BC; YEAR>0 is AD)
        
        With 1 argument:
        YYYYMMDD (long) -> the input date in YYYYMMDD format.

 NOTES:
        (1) You cannot abbreviate YEAR.  If you specify 10/14/97
            DAY_OF_YEAR will compute the day number for 14 Oct 97 AD 
            instead of 14 Oct 1997 AD

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        PRINT, DAY_OF_YEAR( 10, 14, 1997 )

             ; The same as example #1, but this time we call
             ; DAY_OF_YEAR with a date in YYYYMMDD format

        (3)
        PRINT, DAY_OF_YEAR( 1, 1, 1 )
          1
             ; Beginning of the "Anno Domini" era: 1 Jan 1 AD

 NAME:
        DEFAULT_DIRS

 PURPOSE:
        Define a couple of system variables to facilitate 
        file searching across or in multiple platforms.
        The settings are made depending on the host name which
        is queried with getenv(). 
          This file is meant to be modified for your own computing
        environment and directory structure. It's probably a good 
        idea to include a call to Default_Dirs in your startup file.
        A string (or string array) argument allows individual users
        to add their own default settings for individual projects
        (see INPUTS).

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DEFAULT_DIRS [,projectlist [,searchpath=searchpath] ]

 INPUTS:
        PROJECTLIST -> A string or string array containing the names
            of projects of individual users for which additional
            settings shall be made. For each entry for which a procedure
            named default_<projectname>.pro exists, this procedure
            will be called with the host name (lower case) as argument.
            If the procedure is not found, a warning message is issued.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        SEARCHPATH -> A string that will be inserted at the beginning 
            of the !PATH variable to look for the default_<projectname>
            procedures. This keyword is only evaluated when a
            PROJECTLIST is present. For simplicity, the user must make sure
            that SEARCHPATH adheres to the syntax of the curent OS. Since
            DEFAULT_DIRS is usually caled from the startup file, this
            shouldn't be too much of a problem.
           
         /PRINT -> print all system variables ending in 'DIR' after
            the definition. 

 OUTPUTS:
        Various system variables are created. As a minimum, these are
          !RootDir = the root of the file system
          !HomeDir = the user's home directory
          !DataDir = a general data depository
          !TmpDir  = a temporary directory

          !FNSep   = filename seperator ('/' for unix and '\' for windows)

        Further project-specific directories should also end in 'Dir',
        this allows an easy query of all default directories:
          help,/system_variables,output=o
          print,o[ where(strpos(o,'DIR') gt 0) ]
        (see PRINT keyword).
 *******  NEED TO WORK THAT OUT !! ******  it's not that easy !!!  *********

 SUBROUTINES:
        none.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        none.

 NOTES:
        This routine uses a common block (yes!) to remember whether
        the user had already been warned about non-exisiting project
        procedures. Therefore, when you add projects on the fly,
        you can probably call default_dirs safely every time you wish 
        to compose a search mask.

 EXAMPLE:
        default_dirs    ; set platform dependent default directories

        default_dirs,['GTE','CTM'],searchpath='~/myprogs',/PRINT
        ; as above, but add definitions from default_gte.pro and
        ; default_ctm.pro which may be in ~/myprogs or the regular
        ; IDL search !PATH. Print all !...DIR system variables upon 
        ; exit. See attached default_gte procedure for an example.

 NAME:
        DEFAULT_GTE

 PURPOSE:
        Define default system variables for GTE data directories
        and GTE programs. Specific entries are made for the
        PEM-Tropics A and B projects.
        This procedure is caled from DEFAULT_DIRS when 'GTE' is
        added as an argument.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DEFAULT_GTE,host

 INPUTS:
        HOST -> the name of the host computer which is running IDL.
            In our environment these are sol or cyclope or now.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

 OUTPUTS:
        Additional system variables are created:
           !GTE_Dir   = home of GTE data on current platform
           !PEMTA_Dir = PEM-Tropics A data
           !PEMTB_Dir = PEM-Tropics B data

           !GTE_Filetypes = list of fiel extensions used with GTE data

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        It is assumed that this routine is called from DEFAULT_DIRS
        although it should be working stand-alone as well.

 NAME:
        DEFAULT_RANGE  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Make sure a RANGE argument or keyword is a valid vector with 
        at least two elements.  Can also be used to limit RANGE to
        two elements.  The argument may be a string containing one or 
        more numeric values delimited by almost any character 
        combination (including '..' and '-').  A '-' will be treated 
        as a separator if it is preceeded by a digit or not followed
        by a digit.  The resulting range will be sorted and spans the 
        minimum and maximum of the "data" given in the argument.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RANGE = DEFAULT_RANGE( ARG, DEFAULT [,/LIMIT2] )

 INPUTS:
        ARG -> The range argument or keyword as passed into 
              a procedure or function. This can be an undefined
              variable or a variable with 1 or more elements.
              If ARG contains 1 element, it will be repeated 
              to range from and to the same number.

        DEFAULT -> A 2-element vector containing the default range 
              if ARG is undefined. This argument is mandatory
              although it is not used if ARG contains at least 
              1 element.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /LIMIT2 -> Limit the resulting RANGE vector to 2 elements.
               Default is to return *at least* 2 elements.

        RANGE -> Limit the RANGE vector to minimum and maximum 
               value given by this keyword.

        /NOSORT -> Do not sort the output. This can be useful for
               longitude vectors spanning the Pacific ;-)

 OUTPUTS:
        RANGE -> A two (or more) element vector that can be used in
               statements like WHERE(x ge RANGE[0] AND x lt RANGE[1]).

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        ISALGEBRAIC (function)   ISDIGIT (function) 
        STRBREAK    (function)   STRREPL (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        This function is meant for argument checking in procedures
        or functions, hence it will generally not be called from the
        command line.

 EXAMPLE:
        LATRANGE = DEFAULT_RANGE( LATRANGE, [-90.,90.] )

             ; Suppose a procedure has a keyword parameter named 
             ; LATRANGE.  Before we use LATRANGE in any form, we 
             ; should test it (as above).  This ensures that we have 
             ; at least 2 elements in LATRANGE and it defaults
             ; LATRANGE to the whole globe if nothing was passed 
             ; in the LATRANGE keyword.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        DISTRIBUTE

 PURPOSE:
        Collect all the routine names and file names that are
        used in a given program.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DISTRIBUTE [, ROUTINENAME ]

 INPUTS:
        ROUTINENAME -> (OPTIONAL) The name of the routine to be 
             searched.  If omitted, then the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILE -> Name of file where output will be sent.  If
             OUTFILE is omitted then DISTRIBUTE will print the
             information to the screen.

        /NO_IDL -> Set this switch to exclude IDL library routines
             from the search process.

 OUTPUTS:
        A list of filenames with full pathnames and a list of 
        routinenames together with the filenames where they can 
        be found.  Sorry, for local files, no pathname is provided.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        Unfortunately there is no way to figure out which routines
        really belong to a given ROUTINENNAME, so DISTRIBUTE will 
        always return too many routinenames and filenames, including 
        itself and FILE_EXIST, as well as a couple of IDL standard 
        library routines (The latter can be left out with the keyword 
        NO_IDL).  In order to get the closest results, run DISTRIBUTE 
        only at the start of an IDL session.

 EXAMPLE:
        DISTRIBUTE, 'iterate'
        
             ; Get all routines that belong to "iterate.pro". 
             ; A subsequent call with routinename 'create_master' 
             ; will return both, the routines for "create_master.pro" 
             ; and the routines for "iterate.pro".

        DRAWDOTONMAP, X, Y, R, THETA, NAME, COLOR  [, ALIGN=ALIGN ]

 INPUTS:
        X -> Longitude of the point to be drawn (degrees)

        Y -> Latitude of the point to be drawn (degrees)

        R -> Radius (in degrees) of the line that will extend from
             the point to the the label.

        THETA -> Angle (in the trigonometric sense, 0=due east) 
             which specifies the direction of the line that will
             connect the plot label to the point.

        NAME -> String for the plot label.  Default is ''.

        COLOR -> Color of the point to be plotted.  Default 
             is !MYCT.BLACK.  


 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ALIGN -> Specifies the alignment of NAME.  Works in the same
             way as the ALIGN keyword to XYOUTS (e.g. ALIGN=0 is
             left-justified, ALIGN=0.5 is centered, ALIGN=1 is 
             right-justified).

        along the X or Y dimension.
  
 CATEGORY:
	 Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	 ERRORBAR, XARR, YARR, ERROR [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        XARR, YARR -> Arrays of X and Y values correspoinding
             to the location of the data points.  XARR and YARR
             must have the same number of elements.

        ERROR -> An array (or scalar) of error values.  If ERROR
             is a scalar, its value will be used for all data
             points.  If ERROR is an array, it must be of the
             same dimension as XARR and YARR, or else an error
             message will be generated.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /X -> If set, will plot error bars along the X-dimension.
             Default is to plot error bars along the Y-dimension.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS
        None

 NOTES: 
        ERRORBAR just plots the error bars, but not the
        data points.  This is useful if you want to use 
        different colors for data points and error bars.

 NAME:
        EXAMPLE_OVERPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        Example program for overlay of data with model results.
        This program is meant to provide a demonstration example
        rather than a ready-to-use program, so please copy it
        and adapt it to your needs.
          For a try, just call EXAMPLE_OVERPLOT with no options.
        Before you rewrite this code, try some of the keyword 
        options to get a feel how it works.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Examples, GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        EXAMPLE_OVERPLOT [,DATA [,ALTITUDE]] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> A vector with your vertical profile data. If nothing
           is supplied, a dummy ozone profile is generated.

        ALTITUDE -> Altitude vector correspondign to your data. If not
           supplied, a vector will be created ranging from 0-12 km.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        Keywords to select certain model results:
        DIAGN -> Name (or number) of a diagnostic. Default is 'IJ-AVG-$'

        TRACER -> A tracer number (default is 2 = 'Ox')

        TAU0 -> A time step value. You can specify a date using the
             NYMD2TAU function.

        Keywords to select the geographical domain:
        LONRANGE, LATRANGE -> 2-element vectors specifying the minimum
             and maximum longitude and latitude for the model results
             to be considered. Not that LONRANGE[1] < LONRANGE[0] is 
             possible, denoting a region across the Pacific.

        Keywords to change the appearance of the plot:
        TITLE -> Give your plot a title. Default is 'EXAMPLE PLOT'
             with longitude and latitude rang and date.
             If you are sure that you select only one data record each
             time, you can leave it up to CTM_PLOT to construct a title
             (simply remove the TITLE keyword in the call to CTM_PLOT).
             Note that you can take advantage of various "variables"
             with the '%NAME%' notation (see GAMAP documentation for
             details).

        _EXTRA -> Look at the documentation of CTM_PLOT and add your
             favorite keywords to the call to EXAMPLE_OVERPLOT. You are
             likely to use XRANGE or XSTYLE. 

 OUTPUTS:
        just a plot ;-)

 SUBROUTINES:
        none

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses ctm_get_dat and ctm_plot as well as everything that is

 NAME:
        E_H2O  

 PURPOSE:
        Calculate water vapour pressure for a given temperature

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = E_H2O( TEMPERATURE [,/WATER,/ICE,minval=minval] )

 INPUTS:
        TEMPERATURE --> dew or frostpoint reading in K. If you supply
              the dry air temperature (or static air temperature),
              you will get a value for the water vapor saturation 
              pressure.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /WATER --> interprete temperature as dewpoint (default)

        /ICE --> interpret temperature as frostpoint

        MINVAL -> minimum valid data value (default -1.0E30)

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The water vapour pressure [hPa]

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The algorithm has been taken from the NASA GTE project data
        description.

 EXAMPLE:
        PH2O = E_H2O(266.)

             ; Calculate water vapor pressure for a 
             ; dewpoint reading of 266 K

        RH = PH2O/E_H2O(283.)

             ; Compute relative humidity 
             ; (divide ph2o by saturation pressure of DRY temperature)

        PRINT,PH2O,RH
          3.61742     0.294607
 
             ; Prints values        

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 23 Feb 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 03 Aug 1997: split e_h2o and rh, renamed, added template
        mgs, 23 May 1998: changed default behaviour to set reference
               temperature to given TD value
        mgs, 29 Aug 1998: VERSION 2.00
          - much simpler and more logical interface
          - no automatic detection of dew- or frostpoint any longer
          - can now accomodate arrays

 NAME:
        FCONVERT_UNIT (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Wrapper for CONVERT_UNIT.  Passes all of the input data to
        CONVERT_UNIT and returns the result to the calling program.

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = FCONVERT_UNIT( DATA, UNIT, TOPARAM [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> A data vector, array, or a single value that shall
            be converted to a new unit. 

        UNIT -> A string variable containing the (current) unit of 
            DATA. This will be replaced by the new unit afterwards.
            If omitted, you must give the FROM_UNIT keyword to 
            indicate the current unit of DATA.

        TOPARAM -> The unit to convert DATA to. This is equivalent to 
            the keyword TO_UNIT and overwrites it.;  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        RESULT -> returns 1 if conversion was successful, 0 otherwise
            This keyword is mostly for consistency witholder routines.
            It is more convenient to test !ERROR_STATE.CODE for being
            0.

        _EXTRA=e -> Passes extra keywords to CONVERT_UNIT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 NAME:
        FILE_EXIST

 PURPOSE:
        FILE_EXIST checks to see whether a specified file
        can be found on disk, or if it does not exist.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = FILE_EXIST( FILE [,OPTIONS])

 INPUTS:
        FILE (str) --> the name of the file to be checked

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        PATH -> a path string (e.g. the IDL system variable !PATH)
            or a list (string array) of directory names to be
            searched for FILE. Under Unix, a trailing '/' is 
            attached to each entry; under Windows, a trailing 
            '\'; under MacOS, a trailing ':'.  VMS isn't supported. 

        FULL_PATH -> returns the path of FILE if found.  This is 
            not a true systemwide path but rather a combination
            of a PATH element (which may be relative) and FILE.

        DIRNAMES -> This keyword is now replaced by PATH, and 
            should not be used any more.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> =1 if the file is found or =0 otherwise

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================================
        ADD_SEPARATOR (function)   MFINDFILE (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        (1) The PATH entries are expanded prior to use, so it is 
            possible to specify e.g. '~mgs/bla.pro'

        (2) FILE_EXIST will always return the first file it 
            finds that matches your specification. 

 EXAMPLES: 
        (1)
        IF ( FILE_EXIST( 'file_exist.pro' ) ) THEN PRINT, 'Found it!'

             ; Search for file_exist.pro 
       
        (2)
        DIRS = [ '../', '~/DATA/' ]
        OK   = FILE_EXIST( 'test.dat', path=dirs, full=path )
        IF ( OK ) THEN OPENR, U1, PATH
        ...
 
             ; Search for a file given a list of directories.
             ; If file is found, then open it for reading.
         
        
 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 26 Sep 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 28 Sep 1997: - added expand_path() in order to digest ~-pathnames
                          - initializes FULL_PATH with a zero string

 PURPOSE:
        Returns an index array which can be used to determine 
        which CTM grid boxes lie within a given country.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = FIND_CELLS_BY_COUNTRY( COUNTRYID, GRIDINFO [, Keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        COUNTRYID -> Name of the country you are interested in, OR
             the country ID number ID from "countries.table".  

        GRIDINFO -> Structure from CTM_GRID which defines the output
             CTM model grid in which you wish to find a given country.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /MAXIMIZE -> Set this switch to search for all grid boxes that
             contain any portion of the specified country.  The
             default is to determine the specified country by the
             center of the grid box.

        /INDEX -> Set this switch to return RESULT as an 1-D index 
             vector (i.e. similar to output from the WHERE command). 

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Integer index array for OUTGRID.  Grid boxes where 
             RESULT[I,J] = 1 designate the desired country.  If the
             /INDEX flag is set then RESULT will be an 1-D index
             vector (i.e. similar to output from the WHERE command).

            (b) countries.generic.025x025.gif

        (2) The search algorithm is brute-force (i.e. FOR loops
            over lat & lon).  Maybe in a later version we can 
            optimize this w/ IDL array notation.

 NAME:
        FIND_UNIT

 PURPOSE:
        Return classification and conversion information for
        physical units. You pass a unit name, and you will
        get a standard form of that name as well as a factor
        and an offset that convert the unit to SI standard.
        To convert one unit to another, use FIND_UNIT twice
        (see example below).

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        FIND_UNIT,NAME,STDNAME,FACTOR,OFFSET,CATEGORY [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        NAME -> A string containing the name to search for

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /GET_SI -> Return the name of the SI unit of the category of 
            the given unit. Factor and offset will always be 1.0 and 
            0.0, CATEGORY will contain the category number.
 
        /NO_STANDARD -> Do not return the standard name of a unit. The
            standard spelling is identified as the first occurrence
            of a given unit with the same conversion factor and offset
            in the same category and normally replaces the input name.

        /TEST -> Check standard unit strings for consistency
            This keyword is only useful when you add extra units.

 OUTPUTS:
        STDNAME -> The unit name as saved in the stdunits array
            (e.g. 'KG' is returned as 'kg')

        FACTOR -> A conversion factor to SI 

        OFFSET -> A conversion offset

        CATEGORY -> The class to which the unit belongs:
           -1 : unit not found
            0 : distance
            1 : area
            2 : volume

 NAME:
        GAMAP

 PURPOSE:
        Menu-driven user interface for creating plots with
        the GAMAP package subroutines. The actual data retrieval
        and plotting is done with ctm_plot.pro. This routine
        mainly collects all user requests and passes them on to
        CTM_PLOT.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GAMAP, [ DiagN [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: use all).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        General keywords:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        FILENAME -> CTM output file name. Default is to display a
             pickfile dialog and let the user select. You can have
             wildcards ('*', '?') in your filename which restricts
             the file selection.

        /NOFILE -> Don't query for filename but display all records that
             have already been loaded. This can save you a couple of
             mouse clicks when you want to create several plots with
             data from one file, and it also useful when you want
             to plot data from 'external' files that were converted
             with ctm_make_datainfo. If a filename is given or no
             data were loaded, the file selection dialog will appear
             anyhow.

        /RESETDEFAULTS -> If set, will reset all GAMAP values to their
             defaults.

        /HELP -> Displays a help page.

        RESULT -> Returns a structure with the data subset as plotted and
             the respective X and Y coordinates. Returns only one data
             record though.

        TOPTITLE -> Add a specific title centered on top of each page
             of output.

        Keywords to restrict the number of records displayed for selection:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        TRACER -> A tracer number to restrict record selection

        TAU0 -> Time value (at beginning of record)

        DATE -> 6 digit date (e.g. 940101) at the beginning of the
             output record (this gets translated into a TAU0
             value via the function nymd2tau). You can specify more
             than one date at a time using a vector (e.g. [940101, 940301]).
             For the GISS model(s), you also have to specify /GISS_Date in
             order to get correct tau values. The time is assumed to
             be 00 GMT. For other times use the TAU0 keyword as
             TAU0=nymd2tau(dates,times).

        /GISS_Date -> set this flag if you are using the DATE keyword
             with GISS model output.

        Keywords defining output options (these override defaults in
        gamap.defaults)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        /PS -> If set, will directly send output to the 'idl.ps' file.
             If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether to create
             the 'idl.ps' file.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of file to send PostScript output to.

        /NOTIMESTAMP -> Do not include a user ID and time stamp
             on the postscript plot. Unnecessary if the TIMESTAMP value
             in gamap.defaults is set to 0.

        XSIZE, YSIZE, XOFFSET, YOFFSET -> GAMAP will pass these
             keywords to routine OPEN_DEVICE, for setting the size
             and margins of PostScript output.  

        /DO_BMP -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to BMP files.  DO_BMP overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        BMPFILENAME -> Name of BMP file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in BMPFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             BMPFILENAME is not set, or if DO_BMP is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             BMPFILENAME.

        /DO_GIF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as GIF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to GIF files.  DO_GIF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        GIFFILENAME -> Name of GIF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in GIFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             GIFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_GIF is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             GIFFILENAME.

        /DO_JPEG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to JPEG files.  DO_JPEG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        JPEGFILENAME -> Name of JPEG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in JPEGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             JPEGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_JPEG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             JPEGFILENAME.

        /DO_PNG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as PNG
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to PNG files.  DO_PNG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        PNGFILENAME -> Name of PNG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in PNGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             PNGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             PNGFILENAME.

        /DO_TIFF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as TIFF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to TIFF files.  DO_TIFF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        TIFFFILENAME -> Name of TIFF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in TIFFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             TIFFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             TIFFFILENAME.

        /POLAR -> Set this keyword for polar pots. This forces latitude
             ranges to extend to one pole and longitude ranges to span
             the globe. Polar plots only work for global (at least 
             longitudinally) data sets.  Currently, polar plots are 
             supported only for contour plots.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_PLOT, etc...

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) GAMAP can read ASCII punch files with GEOS or GISS, model II
            diagnostics, binary punch files (as defined in Jan 1999),
            and GEOS-CTM binary restart files. Binary punch files
            are processed much faster and allow "windowing" of output.

        (2) For pixel plots, GAMAP can only plot cylindrical maps
            with rectangular projections.  Arbitrary map projections
            should be possible with any type of contour plot. For 
            polar plots, use the /POLAR keyword. Other projections 
            have not been tested and may lead to unexpected results.

        (3) GAMAP forces map ranges to coincide with the grid box
            edges, so that the map and pixel plot will be aligned.
            Each "pixel" size corresponds to one full grid box.
            For grids with half-polar boxes, it is therefore recommended
            not to plot the polar latitudes, since those boxes will
            show up as full-size boxes and shift the rest of the plot
            accordingly.

        (4) When the user selects multiple data blocks, GAMAP will produce
            a multi-panel plot if !p.multi indicates more than one panel
            on the screen (use the MULTIPANEL procedure to turn it on).
            If you plot only one panel per screen, GAMAP will automatically
            start XInterAnimate to present your own movie to you. Be
            aware that XInterAnimate is limited by your system resources.
            With default window sizes, we can usually display at least
            30 frames.  ADDENDUM: 3-D isopleth maps will not be
            animated. (bmy, 1/22/01)

        (5) Animation frames can also be written to GIF or MPEG
            files.  Defaults can be set in "gamap.defaults", or
            specified via the command line. You can also save individual
            GAMAP plots as GIF files. If you want to animate them later
            (e.g. using ULead's GIF-Animator), make sure to specify the
            RANGE keyword to get identical color schemes (or use contours).

        (6) The GAMAP authors wish to point out that it is still relatively
            expensive to produce color plots on the printer. We encourage
            you to try out contour plots and make a test print on a black
            and white printer before you make a color print.

        (7) The 3-D isopleth maps do not quite work with MULTIPANEL, since
            they are produced with screen capture in the Z-Buffer.  Hence  
            Hence, the X window device has to be re-initialized each time, 
            which negates the MULTIPANEL utility.  PostScript plots of 3-D
            isopleth maps will print one plot per page.  We can live with
            this for the time being.  Isopleth maps can also be written
            to GIF files.

        (8) Now uses D. Fanning's TVREAD function to perform better
            device-independent screen capture. (cf. www.dfanning.com)

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        GAMAP
            ; operates fully interactively

        MULTIPANEL,nplots=6       ; turn on multi-panel environment
        GAMAP
            ; same as above, but produce multi-panel plots with
            ; 6 plots per page

        (2)
        GAMAP, 'IJ-AVG-$', tra=4
            ; Will create a CO (tracer=4) plot for the ND45 diagnostic.
            ; GAMAP will display dialog pickfile box and will scan the
            ; file for all records with ND45 and tracer 4. Those will be
            ; displayed and the user can then select a record to be plotted.

        (3)
        GAMAP, [ 'IJ-AVG-$', 'BIOBSRCE' ], tra=[2,4], $
               date=[19940601, 19940801], $
            FileName='~bmy/terra/CTM4/ctm.pch',/ps
            ; In this example the file is fully specified, hence no file
            ; selection dialog will be displayed. GAMAP scans the file
            ; for all records of 'IJ-AVG-$' and 'BIOBSRCE' and tracers
            ; 2 (OX) and 4 (NOX) and it seelcts only those records that
            ; begin on the first of JUNE or AUGUST 1994. Because the ps
            ; flag is set, the output will be directed to the postscript
            ; file 'idl.ps' without first being displayed on the screen.

        bmy, 17 Feb 1999: VERSION 1.20
                          - Replace DATAINFO.OFFSET by DATAINFO.FIRST,
                            which contains the I, J, L indices of
                            the first grid box
                          - Animation facility added

                            GAMAP_QueryPostScriptOptions.
                          - Also renamed function GAMAP_SelectDataBlock to
                            GAMAP_SelectDataBlocks, since one can now

                            boxes, since TVIMAGE will treat them as
                            whole boxes and the map overlay will be
                            inaccurate!

        mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added ALREADY_PS flag for multi-panel use
                          - animation now only if !p.multi does not
                            have more than 1 panel to display
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: - improved comments and examples
                          - removed unnecessary function MatchFileInfo...
                            (easier with make_selection)

                          - now allows for 2D field plots
        bmy, 17 May 1999: - now resolve DEFAULT_RANGE explicitly and
                            call DEFRANGE_STR2NUM separately
                          - few minor fixes in GAMAP_UserRangeEntry for

                            selection
                          - user selection for longitudes greatly improved
                          - some adjustments in FindNearestEdges, notably
                            for range 0..360. Unfortunately, the 0 meridian
                            gridline will be omitted in such plots. If we
                            wanted to include it we would need to carry
                            an extra GLOBAL flag because lower and upper
                            edges (grid box indices) are identical.
        mgs, 20 May 1999: - added option to save record seelction to file.
        mgs, 24 May 1999: - yet more work had to be done to make lon/lat
                            selection as user would expect it to work.
                          - renamed FindNearestEdges to ..Centers
        mgs, 25 May 1999: - still more fiddling. Yuck!

 NAME:
        GAMAP2_HTML

 PURPOSE:
        Wrapper routine for IDL2HTML.  Is used to call IDL2HTML 
        repeatedly in order to create HTML documentation for each
        of the source code files in the GAMAP installation.  The
        user may sort routines by alphabetical order or by category.

 CATEGORY:
        Documentation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GAMAP2_HTML [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTDIR -> Specifies the directory in which HTML documenation
             will be created.  Passes this to IDL2HTML.

        /ALL_ROUTINES -> Select this option to create an HTML file
             with documentation information about all routines
             in the GAMAP directory.  The output file name will be
             "gamap2_html.pro".

        /BY_ALPHABET -> Select this option to create HTML documentation
             files for GAMAP routines by alphabetical order.  A file
             will be created for each letter of the alphabet.

        /BY_CATEGORY -> Select this option to create HTML documentation
             files for GAMAP routines according to category (as
             specified by the "CATEGORY" tag of the IDL doc header).
             A files will be created for each individual category.

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from the Geos-CHEM ND48
        diagnostics contained in one or more binary punch files.

        The goal is to combine, for one station, all the data blocks
        (there is one per time step) into one single 4-D data block
        (we want the time to be the 4th dimension). This is basically
        to take advantage of support for 4D dataset in GAMAP v2-10.

        GEOS-Chem ND48 (as in v7-04-12) outputs one file for all
        stations and all time steps. GC_COMBINE_ND48 will write one
        file but each timeseries will be in one data block instead of
        as many as the number of timesteps. This will make reading
        the timeseries with CTM_GET_DATA a lot faster.

        Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        applied: moving average and/or daily maximum.

        LIMITATION: daily maximum will not make sense if series do
        not cover full days.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Time Series

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48 [, Keywords ]

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

        By defaults all stations are processed. And one output file
        is created that contains all the stations timeseries.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        INFILE -> one or more station file(s) from ND48
              diagnostic. If more than one file is processed, it is
              assumed that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they
              are in chronological order (this is automatically the
              case, if you insert YYYYMMDD into ND48 filenames in
              input.geos).

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for "stations" files. Can be
             either input or output keyword:

             Input: when defined, ALL files satisfying the MASK
                    keyword in the directory will be selected.

             Ouput: set to a variable name that will contains the DIR
                    of the selected files.

             It is ignored (both input and output roles) if INFILE is
             provided.

             If neither INFILE nor INDIR is set, then a dialog window
             that allows multiple files selection (keep CTRL or SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up.


        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "stations*".

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             new timeseries. Default is 'combined'+INFILE[0], in the
             same directory as stations file. If the full path is not
             included, the file is created in the working directory.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;================= Data Selection ======================

        STATIONNB -> Station(s) number. Can be one or more elements
              (up to the number of stations in ND48). Use to select a
              subset of the stations instead of all of them.

        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data is selected.

              If min and/or max of TIME is outside the range of
              available time steps, the first or last available time
              step is used.

              Note 1: this is also an output keyword. Then, if passed
              by reference, TIME becomes the time vector in
              output. See example (6).

              Note 2: if using DMAX or DAVG, then TIME should be long 
              integer (YYYYMMDD), if not it should be Tau format.

        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NAN,
              EDGE_TRUNCATE, and MISSING).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average. (Local time is not accounted for: days start
              and end at 0 UT everywhere).

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average. (Local time is not accounted for: days
              start and end at 0 UT everywhere).


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        All the following keywords will apply to only ONE
        station. The last one is used if none or more than one is
        requested.

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (1,1,lev,time) even though only one station is
             selected.

        LON -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             longitude of the data set on exit.

        LAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             latitude of the data set on exit.

        LEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of levels for the data set on exit.

        TIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector for the station on exit. Given as Tau values,
             unless DMAX or DAVG is set, then as YYYYMMDD.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, the TIME vector is in local time
             instead of UT. Has no effect if /DMAX or /DAVG.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. particularly useful to double check
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.


 OUTPUTS:
        See output keywords above.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References many routines from GAMAP package. Requires GAMAP
        v2.10 for handling 4D dataset.

 NOTES:
       If memory issues show up, try to save one timeseries (i.e.,
       one station at a time).

 EXAMPLES:

        ;; (1) Read multiple timeseries files selected w/ a pop-up
        window (use SHIFT key for muliple selections). Save with the
        default filename in the default directory:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48


        ;; (2) Like example (1), but saves only the daily max of the
        ;;     9-hours average timeseries:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, /dmax, mavg=8



        ;; (3) read ALL stations files from directory '~/path/'
        ;; without a pop-up window (no interactivity, good for batch
        ;; processing). Default MASk and outfile name are used.

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, indir='~/path/'


        ;; (4) Like example (3) but select only the first available
        ;; station, and save the result in a specified file:

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, Station=1, indir='~/path/', outfile='~/path/series1.bpch'


        ;; (5) read files from directory '~/path/', and select 3rd station.
        ;; Do not save combined timeseries. Get outputs in variables
        ;; data, lon, lat and time.

        GC_COMBINE_ND48, indir='~/path/', station=3, data=data, lon=lon, lat=lat, time=time

        Help, reform(data)
        PLOT, time, data[0,0,0,*], title='Lon= strtrim(lon,2)+'- Lat='+strtrim(lat,2)


        ;; (6) Like (5), but limit the time to 23rd-28th of July
        ;;     2001. Not the use of two commands to get the output
        ;;     time vector.

        time = [nymd2tau(20010723L,20010728l)]

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND49

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from several bpch files into 4D
        data. Typically used with Geos-CHEM ND49 timeseries output
        and met fields in bpch files (a3, a6, i6). 
        
        For met fields, see example (9) and (10).

        Each ND49 and Met Fields file has data for one day. But,
        files with time series that do no cover a day per file, can
        also be processed. See example (11), but keep in mind that
        the daily max or average options are then **** MEANINGLESS
        ****, and should not be used.


        WHAT IS DONE:
        
        (1) We combine all the data blocks for one tracer (there is
        one per time step) into one single 4-D data block (with time
        in 4th dimension). This takes advantage of support for 4D
        dataset introduced in GAMAP v2-10.

        (2) The combined series can be saved into a binary punch
        file. You end up with one file per tracer that covers many
        days of output, instead of one file per day for all
        tracers. The space saving can be more than 60%.

        (3) A subarea (even a single location) can be extracted. But
        for multiple but not contiguous locations, call the routine
        as many time as needed.

        (4) Shorter timeseries can be selected/saved, by specifying
        Tau range, or day (as YYYYMMDD long integer) range if daily
        max or average is selected.

        (5) Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        performed: moving average and/or daily
        maximum/minimum/average.

        ## LIMITATION ## : full days considered for ND49, ie,
        GEOS-Chem runs should start and end at midnight (YYYYMMDD
        000000 in input.geos)

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        FILELIST -> list of files to process. Usually used as output
             keyword to get the list of files selected with INDIR and
             MASK or through a dialog window.
             Can be used as input. Then INDIR and MASK are ignored.

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for MASK files.  If
             provided, ALL files satisfying the MASK keyword in the
             directory will be selected. If not provided, a dialog
             window that allows multiple files selection (keep SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up. See EXAMPLES below for tips.

             If set to an undefined variable name, it will hold the
             directory of the selected files (output keyword).

             NOTE: If more than one file is processed, it is assumed
             that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they are in
             chronological order (this is the case with GEOS-Chem
             default naming of ND49 output files: they contain
             YYYYMMDD).

        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "ts*.bpch".

        OUTDIR -> Output directory where to save the file with the
             new timeseries data set will be. Default is INDIR. If
             the user has not write permission in INDIR, writintg is
             cancelled.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             timeseries. Default is 'combts_%TRACERNAME%.bpch', for
             COMB ined  T ime  S eries.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;============ To extract subset of data ===================

        LON -> A one or two-elements vector specifying the longitude
            of one location or one area. If LON is outside the ND49
            area, the program print a warning, and uses border
            value.

        LAT -> same as LON, but for Latitudes

        LEV -> same as LON, but for Levels. Refers to the model grid.


        ; - - you can also select indices into the requested 3D cube:

        LLEV -> A one or two-element vector specifying the min and
             max of available levels to be included in the file.
             Default is ALL available levels.
             Default FORTRAN indexing is used: LLEV #1 is the first
             level ***requested*** in ND49. See LEV above otherwise.

        ILON, JLAT -> same as LLEV but for Longitude and Latitude
             indices. Starting at 1 at the first ***requested***
             grid box in ND49.


        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data are selected.
              TIME must be given as Tau (double) or YYYYMMDD (long)
              if /DMAX or /DAVG.
              If both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME are set, TIME is
              ignored. 

          ** TIP ** if you select a short time span, it may be
                    useful to limit the number of files to process
                    by redefining MASK or using FILELIST. That will
                    speed up the process.


        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NaN,
              Edge_truncate, missing).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average.

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average.

        LOCALTIME -> to get DAVG or DMAX computed over local days
              instead of UT days. See details below.


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (nLon, nLat, nLevel, ntime) even if only one location is
             selected.

        OUTLON -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of longitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of latitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of Levels of the data set on exit.

        OUTALT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of altitudes for the data set on exit.

        OUTTIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector corresponding to the data set on exit. Format
             is Tau, or YYYYMMDD if /DMAX.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, OUTTIME becomes a Nb_OutLon X Nb_TimeStep
             array, with each vector OUTTIME[i,*] holding the time
             vector in local time instead of UT. That vector will
             apply to all j and k for DATA[i,j,k,*].


           Specific case of...  both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME
             being set. The daily max (average) is obtained after
             shifting the timeseries, so they start at 00 LT
             everywhere (or the first available time step just before
             00 LT). The first max (average) value is for the first
             complete local day of the series. The OUTTIME array is
             then a [numbers of complete days, 2] array that gives
             the local YYYYMMDD for both positive and negative
             longitudes.

             See also note about TAU0/TAU1 below.

             Note that the time step of the series must be small
             enough for the DMAX/DAVG w/r/t Local Time to be
             reliable.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. Particularly useful to double check the
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.


 OUTPUTS:
        See output keywords above.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References many routines from GAMAP package. Requires GAMAP
        v2.10 for saving 4D dataset into binary punch file.

 NOTES:
        ######## ND49 and Met Fields only. For ND48, see  ########
        ######## GC_COMBINE_ND48 (not as well maintained) ########

        Written with batch processing in mind. It is recommended to
        save all ND49 outputs into one dedicated directory, and to
        use keywords (INDIR, OUTDIR, OUTFILE..) and save the new
        combined timeseries in a new directory.

        About TAU0 and TAU1 : in the DataInfo structure, they are set
        to the beginning and end of the timeseries. For daily data,
        we compute them by setting HH:MM:SS to 00:00:00. If LocalTime
        is set, UT is still used for TAU0 and TAU1, so we can use
        only one value. If both LocalTime and DMAX are set, tau0 and
        tau1 give the first and last (local) days for longitudes less
        than 0 (west). For East longitudes, you need to add one day
        to these to get the correct date.
 

 EXAMPLES:
        ;; In the following examples, it is assumed that tracer 1
        ;; has been saved with ND49


        ;; (1) Read multiple timeseries files selected w/ a pop-up

 NAME:
        GETDATABLOCK

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve information stored in a DATA block somewhere
        within an IDL routine. The DATA block must be "hidden"
        as comment lines for the IDL compiler. The data will be 
        returned as string array.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GETDATABLOCK, DATA [, FILENAME=FILENAME, ,LABEL=LABEL ]

 INPUTS:

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> optional filename. Normally, the data block is
            read from the file that contains the current procedure

        LABEL -> a unique identifier for the start of the data block.
            Default is '/DATA/'. The end of the data block is reached
            at the end of file or if the block of comment lines ends.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> a string array with the information contained in the 
            data block

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ======================================
        FILE_EXIST (function)   ROUTINE_NAME

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The file with the datablock is always searched in !PATH

 EXAMPLE:
        GETDATABLOCK, SDATA

             ; This will retrieve a data block labeled '/DATA/' 
             ; from the file of the current IDL routine

        Computing pressure and eta coordinates:
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        In a vertical column, the pressure at the bottom edge of 
        grid box (L) is given by:

           Pe(L)   = A(L) + ( B(L) * Psurface )

        and the pressure at the vertical midpoint of grid box (L)
        is just a simple average of the pressures at the box edges:

           Pc(L)   = ( Pe(L) + Pe(L+1) ) * 0.5

        From PEDGE and PCENTER, we can construct the unitless coordinate 
        ETA (which is very similar to the sigma coordinate) as follows:

           ETAe(L) = ( Pe(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop ) 

           ETAc(L) = ( Pc(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )
 
        For GAMAP plotting routines, we will use the ETA coordinate 
        for hybrid models instead of the sigma coordinate.

        Psurface is a function of longitude and latitude.  GAMAP uses 
        a default Psurface of 1013 hPa (1 atm).  However, you should 
        always compute the pressure edges and centers from an accurate 
        surface pressure field (i.e. from met field data files or from 
        GEOS-Chem or other model output.
   
 EXAMPLE:
        EETA = GETETA( 'GEOS4' PSURF=984.0, /EDGES );
             ; assigns GEOS-1 eta edges to array EETA

        CETA = GETETA( 'GEOS4', /CENTERS, PRESSURE=CPRESS )
             ; assigns GISS-II eta centers to array CETA
             ; (Optional) also returns the pressure at level centers

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DEVICE -> Set this switch to compute the average character
             size in device units (which is usually pixel) instead of 
             the default normal coordinates.

        MYFORMAT = GET_DEFAULTFORMAT(minval,maxval [,/LOG])

 INPUTS:
        MINVAL, MAXVAL -> the range of values that shall be 
            displayed with this format.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /LOG -> set this keyword if you plan logarithmic labels.
            (changes behaviour for 0.001)

        DEFAULTLEN -> 1 or 2 strings with the default length 
            specification for 'f' and 'e' formats. If only one
            string is passed, it will be used for both, otherwise
            the first string applies to 'f' and the second to 'e'.
            Example: DEFAULTLEN='10.3' results in 'f10.3'.

        THRESHOLD -> threshold value to switch from 'f' to 'e' format.
            Default is '2' for linear and '3' for log scale. This
            value is determined by the negative decadal log of (maxv-minv)
            plus 2.

 OUTPUTS:
        MYFORMAT -> A format string (e.g. '(f14.2)' )

 SUBROUTINES:
        none

 REQUIREMENTS:
        none

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        PRINT, GET_DEFAULTFORMAT( 0.01, 1. )
          '(f14.2)'

        PRINT, GET_DEFAULTFORMAT( 0.0001, 0.01 )

 NAME:
        GET_DIFF_RANGE

 PURPOSE:
        Returns a default plotting range for given GEOS-Chem tracers 
        This will be used to create absolute difference plots for 
        GEOS-Chem benchmarking.

 CATEGORY:
        Benchmarking

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RANGE = GET_DIFF_RANGE( TRACERNAME )

 INPUTS:
        TRACERNAME -> Name of the tracer for which a default
             plotting range will be returned.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RANGE -> A 2 element vector with the [min,max] values
             to be used in creating a tracer difference plot.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Routine READ_DIFF_RANGE must be called before this routine
        may be used.  This will normally be done at the top of
        driver routine BENCHMARK_1MON.

 NOTES:
        (1) Meant to be used in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem 
            benchmark plotting codes.
 
        (2) Default ranges for each tracer are read from a file by the 
            complementary routine READ_DIFF_RANGE and stored in the
            GDR common block.

 EXAMPLE:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE, 'diff_range.1mon'
        PRINT, GET_DIFF_RANGE( 'NOx' )
            -0.100000  0.100000

 NAME:
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS

 PURPOSE:
        Returns zonal mean pressure edges and pressure centers
        for the GEOS-5 grid (47 layers or 72 layers).  Because in
        GEOS-5 we cannot compute the pressures at grid box edges
        and centers, we must read them in from disk.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Models & Grids

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS, PEDGE, PMID [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Specifies the name of the file containing
             average pressures on the GEOS-5 grid.  If FILENAME
             is omitted, then GET_GEOS5_PRESS will use the default
             filename: "pedge.geos5.{RESOLUTION}.year".  

        NLAYERS -> Specifies the number of layers in the GEOS-5 
             grid.  NLAYERS can be either 47 or 72.  Default is 47.

        RESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the GEOS-5 grid. 
             Default is 4x5.

        PSURF -> If specified, then PEDGE and PMID will be 1-D
             vectors, with the surface pressure (i.e. PEDGE[0])
             being closest to the passed value of PSURF. 

        /VERBOSE -> Set this switch to toggle verbose output.

 OUTPUTS:
        PEDGE -> Array (or vector if PSURF is specified) of pressures 
             at GEOS-5 grid box edges.  The PEDGE values have been 
             averaged over 12 months and also averaged over longitudes 
             (i.e. zonal mean).
 
        PMID -> Array (or vector if PSURF is specified) of pressures 
             at GEOS-5 grid box centers.  The pressures have been 
             averaged over 12 months and also averaged over longitudes 
             (i.e. zonal mean).

 SUBROUTINES:

 NOTES:
        (1) At present, we only have saved out a file containing
            pressure edges from the GEOS-5 47-layer model.

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        GET_GEOS5_PRESS, PEDGE, PMID, RES=2

             ; Returns pressues at grid box edges (PEDGE) and centers
             ; (PMID) for the GEOS-5 47L model at 2 x 2.5 resolution.
             ; PEDGE is a 2-D array of size 91x48.  PMID is also a

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME (optional) -> Name of the input GIF file.  
             If FILENAME is omitted then GIF2PS will prompt
             the user to supply a file name via a dialog box.
             FILENAME may contain wild card characters.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the output PostScript file.
             Default is "idl.ps".

        /FLIP_BW -> Set this keyword to turn black pixels into
             white pixels and vice-versa.  This is useful for
             creating PostScript files of GIF images that have a 
             dark background color.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Image processing options are limited to flipping the
            black and white pixels.  This should be good enough
            for most purposes.

        (2) XMARGIN and YMARGIN assume that we are printing out for
            standard USA 8.5 x 11" page.  Device sizes listed below
            are also in inches.  

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        GIF2PS, 'my_gif.gif', OUTFILENAME='my_ps.ps'

             ; Translates the image in "my_gif.gif" to

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        HCOLORBAR assumes n_elements(COLORS) >= n_elements(LABELS)+1

 NOTES:
       (1) HCOLORBAR is more or less obsolete.  You should use
           the COLORBAR routine instead.  However, there may be
           some applications where HCOLORBAR is required, so we
           keep this routine for backwards compatibility with
           older IDL code.

       (2) The colorbar will be plotted as follows:

             LABELS(0)   LABELS(1)                     LABELS(NL-1)
    +-----------+-----------+----------- // --------------+------------+
    | COLORS(0) | COLORS(1) | COLORS(2)  //  COLORS(NL-1) | COLORS(NL) |
    +-----------+-----------+----------- // --------------+------------+

        COLORS(0) = color index for data < first contour level
        COLORS(1) = color index for data between 1st and 2nd levels
           ...
        COLORS(NL) = color index for data >= the last contour level

        LABELS(0)  = label for the first contour level
        LABELS(1)  = label for the 2nd contour level, etc...
           ...
        LABELS(NL) = label for data >= the last contour level

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to write data into the Hierarchical Data
        Format Scientific Dataset (HDF-SD) structure

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        HDF_SETSD, FID, DATA, NAME [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FID -> HDF File ID, as returned by routine HDF_SD_START.

        DATA -> Data (array or scalar) to be written to HDF-SD format.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved

        DATATYPE      (function) 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ HDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) Since HDF supports the STRING type, we do not have to
            treat BYTE data like ASCII characters (cf ncdf_set.pro)

 EXAMPLE:
 
        ; Find out if HDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( HDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'HDF not supported!'

        ; Open the HDF file
        FID = HDF_SD_START( 'myhdf.hdf', /Create )

 NAME:
       HIST_ND

 PURPOSE:

       Perform an N-dimensional histogram, also known as the joint
       density function of N variables, ala HIST_2D.

 CATEGORY:
       Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       hist=HIST_ND(V,BINSIZE,MIN=,MAX=,NBINS=,REVERSE_INDICES=)

 INPUTS:

       V: A NxP array representing P data points in N dimensions.  

       BINSIZE: The size of the bin to use. Either an N point vector
         specifying a separate size for each dimension, or a scalar,
         which will be used for all dimensions.  If BINSIZE is not
         passed, NBINS must be.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS: 

       MIN: The minimum value for the histogram.  Either a P point
         vector specifying a separate minimum for each dimension, or
         a scalar, which will be used for all dimensions.  If
         omitted, the natural minimum within the dataset will be
         used.

       MAX: The maximum value for the histogram.  Either a P point
         vector specifying a separate maximmum for each dimension, or
         a scalar, which will be used for all dimensions. If omitted,
         the natural maximum within the dataset will be used.

       NBINS: Rather than specifying the binsize, you can pass NBINS,
         the number of bins in each dimension, which can be a P point
         vector, or a scalar.  If BINSIZE it also passed, NBINS will
         be ignored, otherwise BINSIZE will then be calculated as
         binsize=(max-min)/nbins.  Note that *unlike* RSI's version
         of histogram as of IDL 5.4, this keyword actually works as
         advertised, giving you NBINS bins over the range min to max.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       
       MIN,MAX,NBINS: See above
       
       REVERSE_INDICES: Set to a named variable to receive the
         reverse indices, for mapping which points occurred in a
         given bin.  Note that this is a 1-dimensional reverse index
         vector (see HISTOGRAM).  E.g., to find the indices of points
         which fell in a histogram bin [i,j,k], look up:

             ind=[i+nx*(j+ny*k)]
             ri[ri[ind]:ri[ind+1]-1]

         See also ARRAY_INDICES for converting in the other
         direction.

 OUTPUTS:

       hist: The N-Dimensional histogram, of size N1xN2xN3x...xND
         where the Ni's are the number of bins implied by the data,
         and/or optional inputs min, max and binsize.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:

       The reverse indices.

 EXAMPLE:
       
       v=randomu(sd,3,100)
       h=hist_nd(v,.25,MIN=0,MAX=1,REVERSE_INDICES=ri)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Mon Mar 5 09:45:53 2007, J.D. Smith <jdsmith@as.arizona.edu>

               Correctly trim out of range elements from the
               histogram, when MIN/MAX are specified. Requires IDL
               v6.1 or later.

       Tue Aug 19 09:13:43 2003, J.D. Smith <jdsmith@as.arizona.edu>

               Slight update to BINSIZE logic to provide consistency
               with HIST_2D.

       Fri Oct 11 10:10:01 2002, J.D. Smith <jdsmith@as.arizona.edu>

               Updated to use new DIMENSION keyword to MAX/MIN.

       Fri Apr 20 12:57:34 2001, JD Smith <jdsmith@astro.cornell.edu>

               Slight update to NBINS logic.  More aggressive keyword
               checking.

       Wed Mar 28 19:41:10 2001, JD Smith <jdsmith@astro.cornell.edu>

               Written, based on HIST_2D, and suggestions of CM.

 PURPOSE:
	Overlay an image and a map (satellite projection)

 CATEGORY:
	Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	IMAGE_MAP, A

 INPUTS:
	A -> The two-dimensional array to display.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       WINDOW_SCALE -> Set this keyword to scale the window size to 
           the image size. Otherwise, the image size is scaled to 
           the window size.  This keyword is ignored when outputting 
           to devices with scalable pixels (e.g., PostScript).
           [original as in image_contour]

	ASPECT-> Set this keyword to retain the image's aspect ratio.
	    Square pixels are assumed.  If WINDOW_SCALE is set, the 
	    aspect ratio is automatically retained.
           [original as in image_contour]

	INTERP -> If this keyword is set, bilinear interpolation 
           is used if the image is resized.
           [original as in image_contour]

       CENTERX -> longitudinal position of geostationary satellite
           (default -135 = GEOS-9)

       DIST -> distance of satellite from Earth surface (in earth radii)
           (default = 7)

       CONTINENTS -> superimpose map continents on the image

 OUTPUTS:
	No explicit outputs.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The currently selected display is affected.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	None

 NOTES:
       Derived from IDL routine image_contour.
       Not very flexible - quick hack to analyze PEM-T data

 PROCEDURE:
	If the device has scalable pixels, then the image is written over
	the plot window.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = IND_COMB( INDEX1, INDEX2, TYPE [, keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        INDEX1, INDEX2 --> the two index arrays (may be single 
             integers or -1, but must be given)

        TYPE --> a string containing the type of index combination:
             The result will contain an index value if the index is 
             contained in ...
               type eq "OR":   ... at least one of INDEX1 or INDEX2
               type eq "AND":  ... INDEX1 and INDEX2

               type eq "NAND": ... not in both
             The default combination is "OR".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        TOTALN --> optional: number of elements in the data set. 
             If not given, this value is calculated as 
             max([index1,index2]).  If this argument is passed,

 NAME:
        INTERPOLATE_2D

 PURPOSE:
        Interpolates a 2-D array from one grid to another.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NEWDATA = INTERPOLATE_2D( DATA,    OLDXMID, OLDYMID,    $
                                  NEWXMID, NEWYMID  [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> A 2-D array containing the data to be interpolated.

        OLDXMID -> A 1-D vector containing the X-coordinates (e.g. 
             longitude) corresponding to the DATA array.

        OLDYMID -> A 1-D vector containing the Y-coordinates (e.g. 
             latitude) corresponding to the DATA array.

        NEWXMID -> A 1-D vector containing the X-coordinates (e.g. 
             longitude) of the new grid onto which DATA will be 
             interpolated.

        NEWYMID -> A 1-D vector containing the Y-coordinates (e.g. 
             latitude) of the new grid onto which DATA will be 
             interpolated.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DOUBLE -> Set this switch to force computation in double 
             precision.  Default is to use single precision.

 OUTPUTS:
        NEWDATA -> A 2-D array containing the data on the new grid.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        INTERPOLATE_2D can be used to interpolate from coarse grids
        to fine grids or fine grids to coarse grids.  This routine
        uses the IDL INTERPOL command.
    
 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define old grid (GEOS-Chem 2x25)
        OLDTYPE  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=2 )
        OLDGRID  = CTM_GRID( OLDTYPE        )

        ; Define new grid (GEOS-Chem 4x5)
        NEWTYPE  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        NEWGRID  = CTM_GRID( NEWTYPE        )

        ; Interpolate DATA array from 2x25 to 4x5
        NEWDATA  = INTERPOLATE_2D( DATA,                       $
                                   OLDGRID.XMID, OLDGRID.YMID, $
                                   NEWGRID.XMID, NEWGRID.YMID )

             ; Interpolate a data array from the GEOS-Chem 
             ; 2 x 2.5 grid to the GEOS-Chem 4 x 5 grid

 NAME:
        INV_INDEX

 PURPOSE:
        Find the indices that do NOT match a WHERE condition

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = INV_INDEX( INDEX, TOTALN )

 INPUTS:
        INDEX -> An index array, e.g. previously generated by a
              WHERE command (may be -1)

        TOTALN -> the number of elements in the reference data
              set, i.e. totaln = n_elements(index)+n_elements(result)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> an integer array with all indices that were NOT
              in index or -1 if index was complete

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The function returns -1 if one of the following errors occurs:
        - invalid number of arguments
        - index variable is undefined
        - totaln is less than n_elements(index)
        - totaln less or equal 1, i.e. no associated data
        The last error does not produce an error message, since this
        feature was found to be very useful (in EXPLORE, the widget based
        interactive data explorer)

 EXAMPLE:
        DATA   = FINDGEN( 50 )
        INDEX  = WHERE( DATA ge 25 )
        INVERS = INV_INDEX( INDEX, N_ELEMENTS( DATA ) )

          20 21 22 23 24

             ; Find the elements of DATA that are greater than 25
             ; and then print the inverse condition

 NAME:
        ISLOWER (function)

 PURPOSE:
        IDL analog to the 'islower' routine in C.  Locates all 
        lowercase alphabetic characters in a string.

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = ISLOWER( S )

 INPUTS:
        S  -> The string to be tested

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The value of the function.  RESULT is an index array
                  that contains as many elements as S has characters. 
                  If S is a single character, then RESULT will be scalar.
                  Where RESULT = 1, the corresponding characters in S
                  are lowercase alphabetic.

 NAME:
        ISOPLETH_MAP

 PURPOSE:
        Plots a 3-D (longitude, latitude, altitude) isopleth of
        a data concentration field atop a world map.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        ISOPLETH_3D

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> The data array to be plotted.  DATA must be
             3-dimensional.

        XMID, YMID, ZMID -> XMID is the array of longitude grid box
             centers.  YMID is the array of latitude grid box centers.  
             ZMID is the array of altitude grid box centers.  
             ISOPLETH_MAP will be able to label the X, Y, and Z axes
             based on the values of XMID, YMID, ZMID.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ISOPLETH -> Value of data for which to show an iso-contour surface.  
             Default is 35.0 [ppbv].

        /LOW -> Set this keyword to display the low side of the iso-contour 
             surface (i.e., the contour surfaces enclose high data values). 
             If this keyword is omitted or is 0, the high side of the 
             contour surface is displayed and the contour encloses low
             data values. If this parameter is incorrectly specified,
             errors in shading will result.  

        TITLE1 -> First line of the title that is to be placed atop the plot
             window.  TITLE is passed explicitly to avoid keyword name
             duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.  A default title
             string of "Volume Rendering" will be used if TITLE is not
             passed explicitly.
 
        TITLE2 -> Second line of the title string for the top of the plot
             window.  This line should be used for specifying the value
             and units of the isosurface.  A default string such as:
             "ISOSURFACE = 20.000 [ppbv]" will be created if TITLE2 is
             not passed explicitly.  Also, if TITLE2 is not passed 
             explicitly, the format descriptor string passed via the
             FORMAT keyword will be used to determine the number of
             decimal places 

        USTR -> String to specify the units of the isocontour surface
             (e.g. '[ppbv]', '[kg/s]', etc).  Default is a null
             string, ''.

        FORMAT -> Format descriptor string used in generating a default
             value of TITLE2.  Default is '(f14.3)'.

        MPARAM -> A 3 element vector containing values for
             [ P0Lat, P0Lon, Rot ], for the MAP_SET command.  
             Default is [ 0, 0, 0 ]. Elements not specified are 
             automatically set to zero.

        LIMIT -> A four-element vector which specifies the latitude
             and longitude extent of the map.  The elements of LIMIT
             are arranged thus: [ LatMin, LonMin, LatMax, LonMax ].
             Default is to set LIMIT = [ -90, -180, 90, 180 ] (i.e.
             to include the entire globe). P0Lon will be computed
             to fit into the LIMIT range unless it is explicitely
             requested in MParam.

        MCOLOR -> Color index of the map outline and title characters.
             Default is 1 (MYCT black).

        ACOLOR -> Color index of the 3-D axes which surround the map
             plot.  Defaults is 1 (MYCT black).

        [XYZ]MARGIN -> A 2-element array specifying the margin on
             the left (bottom) and right (top) sides of the plot
             window, in units of character size. Defaults are 
             XMARGIN=[ 5, 3 ], YMARGIN=[ 3, 3], ZMARGIN=[ 3, 3 ].
             These are used to put some "white space" into the plot
             window for aesthetic purposes.

        WINPARAM -> An integer vector with up to 5 elements:
             WINPARAM(0) = window number  (if negative, a window
                           will be opened with the /FREE option.
             WINPARAM(1) = X dimension of window in pixels (width)
             WINPARAM(2) = Y dimension of window in pixels (height)

 OUTPUTS:
        A picture will be displayed in the X-window device.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External subroutines required:
        ------------------------------
        EXTRACT_FILEPATH (function)
        DIALOG_PICKFILE  (function)
        TVIMAGE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        (1) Image processing options are limited to flipping the
            black and white pixels.  This should be good enough
            for most purposes.

        (2) XMARGIN and YMARGIN assume that we are printing out for
            standard USA 8.5 x 11" page.  Device sizes listed below
            are also in inches. 
 
        (3) Refer to the READ_JPEG procedure manual pages for
            JPEG image handling options. 

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        JPEG2PS, 'my_jpg.jpg', OUTFILENAME='my_ps.ps'

             ; Translates the image in "my_jpg.jpg" to 
             ; the PostScript file "my_ps.ps".

        (2)
        JPEG2PS, 'my_jpg.jpg', OUTFILENAME='my_ps.ps', /FLIP_BW
        
             ; Same as in (1), but also changes all black
             ; pixels to white and vice-versa.  

        (3)
        JPEG2PS, 'my_jpg.jpg', OUTFILENAME='my_ps.ps', /FLIP_BW, $
             XMARGIN=0.5, YMARGIN=0.5
        
             ; Same as in (2), but also will "pad" the image with
             ; 0.5" of white space around each side.

             Defaults are 0.98 and 0.03, i.e. the lower right corner.

        WIDTH -> width of the legend box. This parameter is defaulted
             to 40% of the plot area or may be adjusted to hold the
             longest LABEL string if CHARSIZE is given. If WIDTH is
             specified, it is used to determine the CHARSIZE. However,
             if both are given, they are both used and may lead to
             ugly results.

        POSITION -> a four element vector that gives complete control
             over the position of the legend box. Normally, you don't 
             need this keyword, but it may be handy in a multi-plot 
             situation where you want to place a legend independently
             of any individual plotting area. It can also be convenient 
             if you want to place legends interactively: simply call
             a rubberband program that returns the region coordinates 
             in normalized units, and pass this vector to the LEGEND 
             program.

        PLOTPOSITION -> 4 element vector that specifies the plotting 
             area.  Default is taken from !P.POSITION if set, otherwise 
             [0.2,0.1,0.9,0.9] is used as default. As noted above, 
             sizing and positioning of the legend box is with respect 
             to the plot position unless POSITION is specified.

        SYMBOL -> a vector (or one integer) containing symbol numbers 
             to plot. -1 can be used to skip one entry.  These values 
             are arguments to the SYM() function. If you like to
             label plain IDL symbols, use the PSYM keyword instead.
 
        PSYM -> same as symbol, but passes its values directly to PSYM
             in the plots command, i.e. produces generic IDL symbols.

        SYMSIZE -> symbol size. Normally, this value is adjusted auto-
             matically to match the character size. 
        
        COLOR -> a number or vector of color values for the symbols. 
             One entry is used per symbol. If only one entry is 
             provided, all symbols are plotted in the same color. 
             Default is black.

        LINE -> a vector with linestyles. Symbols and lines can be 
             used together. Entries with -1 are skipped.

        LCOLOR -> color values for the lines

        THICK -> line thickness. Can be any number of element. The
                 program cycles through them if there is more lines
                 than elements in THICK. Defaut is 1 for all. 

        LABEL -> a string array containing the legend text lines. 
             One line should correspond to one symbol. If you have a 
             two line entry, you can either pass it as two lines or
             use the '!C' carriage return command. In both cases you 
             have to set the SYMBOL and LINE values that correspond
             to the second line to -1 in order to skip the symbol for 
             it. If you use '!C', your next LABEL should be blank.

        TEXTCOLOR -> A color value for the label and title output.
             Default is black.

        TITLE -> a title string for the legend. 

        CHARSIZE -> character size for all labelling. Default is to 
             determine the character size automatically so that the largest
             LABEL and TITLE fit into the legend box. On the other hand you
             can specify CHARSIZE and have the legend size itself. 

        SPACING -> spacing between legend lines. Default is 2, lower values
             produce narrower spacing and may be useful for extensive 
             legends. You can set the IDL default line spacing by setting
             SPACING to float(!D.Y_CH_SIZE)/!D.X_CH_SIZE.

        NLINES -> number of lines the legend box shall hold. Normally,
             this value is determined automatically from the maximum number
             of entries in SYMBOL, PSYM, LINE, and LABEL. It may however
             be useful to set NLINES manually if you want to ADD extra
             curve identifiers lateron (see ADD keyword), or if your
             last LABEL is a multi line entry (using the '!C' character).

        FRAME -> draw a frame around the legend box. The value of FRAME
             is equal to the color index that will be used to draw the
             FRAME (hence /FRAME draws a black frame with MYCT).

        BOXCOLOR -> a background fill color for the legend box. Default is
             0 (which corresponds to white in MYCT). If you specify a
             negative number, no background box is drawn and your legend 
             may interfere with part of the plot.

        ADD -> set this keyword to add one or more entries to an existing 
             legend. All positioning and size keywords are ignored in this
             case, and the new entries are appended at the bottom. You 
             should use the NLINES keyword in the first call to legend in
             order to properly size your legend box, or (if you draw
             no FRAME and have a neutral BOXCOLOR) you can set VALIGN to 
             e.g. 0.98 to start from the top of the plotting area. 
             Technical NOTE: adding entries to an existing legend is 
             most flexible with the use of the LEGSTRU keyword which will
             return a structure with all necessary parameters to continue
             labelling at the next call. It is also accomplished by means 
             of a common block to facilitate its use. In this case, you can
             only continue the legend you last worked on. 

        LEGSTRU -> a named variable that will contain information to
             continue labelling with the /ADD keyword. Needs to be passed
             back into LEGEND if it shall be used. Otherwise, information
             is taken from a common block.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        DRAWLEGSYM : plots a single plot symbol and line.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        LEGEND uses the STR_SIZE function by David Fanning 
        and FORMSTRLEN to determine "true" size of label strings.
        If ADD keyword is used, you also need CHKSTRU.

        A plot must have been produced prior to calling LEGEND

 NOTES:
        A few color statements require MYCT in the present form
        of this program. See definitions of variables Black and
        White at the beginning of the program.

 NAME:
        LOGLEVELS (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Compute default values for logarithmic axis labeling or 
        contour levels. For a range from 1 to 100 these would be 
        1., 2., 5., 10., 20., 50., 100.  If the range spans more 
        than (usually) 3 decades, only decadal values will be
        returned unless the /FINE keyword is set.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = LOGLEVELS( [ RANGE | MIN=MIN, MAX=MAX ] $
                            [,/FINE ] [ ,COARSE=DEC ] )

 INPUTS:
        RANGE -> A 2-element vector with the minimum and maximum 
            value to be returned. Only levels _within_ this range
            will be returned. If RANGE contains only one element,
            this is interpreted as MAX and MIN will be assumed as
            3 decades smaller. RANGE superseeds the MIN and MAX 
            keywords. Note that RANGE must be positive definite
            but can be given in descending order in which case
            the labels will be reversed.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MIN, MAX -> alternative way of specifying a RANGE. If only 
            one keyword is given, the other one is computed as
            3 decades smaller/larger than the given parameter.
            RANGE superseeds MIN and MAX.

        /FINE -> always return finer levels (1,2,5,...) 

        COARSE -> the maximum number of decades for which LOGLEVELS
            shall return fine labels. Default is 3. (non-integer 
            values are possible).

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> A vector with "round" logarithmic values within 
            the given range.  The original (or modified) RANGE will
            be returned unchanged if RANGE does not span at least 
            one label interval.  The result will always contain at 
            least two elements.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        If COARSE is lt 0, the nearest decades will be returned 
        instead. The result will always have at least two elements.
        If COARSE forces decades, the result values may be out-of-
        range if RANGE spans less than a decade.
        
        Caution with type conversion from FLOAT to DOUBLE !!

 EXAMPLE:
        RANGE   = [ MIN( DATA, MAX=M ), M ]
        C_LEVEL = LOGLEVELS( RANGE )
        CONTOUR, ..., C_LEVEL=C_LEVEL

             ; Define log levels for the CONTOUR command

 NAME:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 PURPOSE:
        Convert bpch files (matching a mask) to netCDF format. 
        The routine can work recursively : files in subdirectories
        are also searched for.
        
        This is a convenient generic wrapper for GAMAP routine
        Bpch2coards.pro, to work on several files and directories at
        once.
        
        When working recursively, the directory tree in the input
        directory is recreated as needed in the output directory.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 INPUTS:
        none

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MASK -> string, default is '*', that is all files

        INPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory of files to convert, if
             not specified, a dialog window pops up

        OUTPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory destination for netCDF
             files, if not specified, a dialog window pops up.

        RECURSION -> to search subdirectories. Default is 0
             (OFF). Set to 1 to turn it on.

        TOKEN -> set if you want to replace 'bpch' with 'nc' in all
             part of the full name. Default is to have extension
            ".nc" added to file name only.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        To work recursively on the directories, I use FILE_SEARCH
        with 2 arguments. This is not possible with MFINDFILE, and
        works only with IDL 5.5 and above. 

 EXAMPLES:

        indir  = '/as/data/geos/GEOS_1x1/EDGAR_200607/'         
        outdir = '/home/phs/data/EDGAR_200607/nc/'             
        mask   = '*1x1'                                          
        make_multi_nc, input_parent_dir=indir, out=outdir, mask=mask, /r

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       <phs@sol.as.harvard.edu>

		now pass _extra keyword to BPCH2COARDS (eg /NAMER
		needed for nested data)

       Thu Feb 19 11:12:16 2009, Philippe Le Sager
       <phs@sol.as.harvard.edu>

               renamed MAKE_MULTI_NC. Added recursion keyword
               (default is OFF). Now **AUTOMATICALLY** creates missing
               subdirectory in output directory tree, when in
               recursive mode.

             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the restart file that will be created.
             Default is "restart.bpch".

        TAU0 -> TAU value (hours from 0 GMT on 01 Jan 1985) that 
             that will be used to timestamp the restart file.
             The default TAU0 value 140256.00 (corresponds to 
             0 GMT on 01 Jan 2001).
 
        TRACERLIST -> A scalar value (or vector) of tracer numbers
             to write to the restart file.  Default is 1.
      
        DATAVALUE -> Specifies the data value that will be assigned
             to all grid boxes in the restart file.  Default is 0e0.

        DIAGN -> Specifies the diagnostic category name that will
             be used to index data fields in the restart file.
             Default is "IJ-AVG-$".

        UNIT -> Use this keyword to overwrite the default unit
             string (as specified in the "tracerinfo.dat" file)
             for each data block in the restart file.

        /NO_VERTICAL -> Set this switch to create a restart file
             with 2-D data blocks (e.g. lon x lat) instead of 3-D
             data blocks (e.g. lon x lat x alt).

        DIM -> Allows you to manually set the dimensions of the
             data blocks (for nested grids).  DIM is passed to
             CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO.

        FIRST -> Allows you to manually set the starting indices
             (in Fortran notation, starting from 1) of the data 
             block.  FIRST is passed to CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO.

 NAME:
        MAKE_SELECTION (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Convert an array of selected values to an index array that
        identifies the selected values in a list or data array. 

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        INDEX = MAKE_SELECTION( NAMES, SELNAMES [,keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        NAMES -> A list or array of values to choose from 

        SELNAMES -> A list of selected values

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ONLY_VALID -> Return only indices of found values. Values not
            found are skipped. Default is to return 1 index value for
            each SELNAME, which is -1 if SELNAME is not contained in 
            NAMES. If ONLY_VALID is set, the -1 values will be deleted,
            and a value of -1 indicates that no SELNAME has been found
            at all.

        REQUIRED -> Normally, MAKE_SELECTION will return indices for
            all values that are found, simply ignoring the selected
            values that are not in the NAMES array (although an error
            message is displayed). Set this keyword to return with
            -1 as soon as a selected value is not found.

        QUIET -> Suppress printing of the error message if a
            selected value is not found (the error condition will
            still be set).

 OUTPUTS:
        INDEX -> A (long) array with indices to reference the 
            selected values in the NAMES array.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        If the NAMES array contains multiple entries of the same value,
        only the index to the first entry will be returned.

        A selection can contain multiple instances of the same value.
        The index array will contain one entry per selected item
        (See example below)

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        NAMES = [ 'Alfred','Anton','Peter','John','Mary']
        INDEX = MAKE_SELECTION( NAMES, ['Peter','Mary'] )
        PRINT, INDEX
          2  4

        (2)
        VALS = INDGEN(20)
        INDEX = MAKE_SELECTION( VALS, [9,-5,8,7,7,8,9] )
        PRINT, INDEX
          9  -1  8  7  7  8  9

        (3)
        INDEX = MAKE_SELECTION( VALS,[9,-5,8,7,7,8,9], /ONLY_VALID )
        PRINT, INDEX
          9  8  7  7  8  9

        (4)
        INDEX = MAKE_SELECTION( vals, [9,-5,8,7,7,8,9], /REQUIRED )
        PRINT, INDEX
          -1


 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 28 Aug 1998: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 29 Aug 1998: - changed behaviour and added ONLY_VALID keyword

 NAME:
        MAP_LABELS

 PURPOSE:
        Constructs map labels from numerical values, in either
        numerical format (e.g. "-90", "0", "90" ), or in
        directional format ( e.g. "90S, "0", "90N" ).

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MAP_LABELS, LATLABEL, LONLABEL [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LATRANGE, LONRANGE -> The range of latitudes (longitudes)
            for the map or plot area.

        LATS, LONS  -> Returns to the calling program the array of
            latitudes (longitudes) used to construct the map labels.
            Can also be use as input: if LATS has one element, the
            LATS vector is build with LATS+n*DLAT; if it has more
            than one element, it is not modified and is the final
            grid.

        DLAT, DLON -> Returns to the calling program the latitude
            (longitude) interval between grid lines.
            Now, can also be used as input so the user can specify
            the grid spacing.

        /MAPGRID -> If set, will assume that latitude and longitude
            labels are for grid lines on a world map.  Also compute
            normal coordinates which can be used for placing the
            labels next to the map.

        NORMLATS -> 2D Array containing normal X and Y
            coordinates for placing latitude labels outside map
            boundaries.  These are computed only if /MAPGRID is set.

        NORMLONS -> 2D-Array containing normal X and Y
            coordinates for placing latitude labels outside map
            boundaries.  These are computed only if /MAPGRID is set.

     Keywords Passed to CONSTRUCT_MAP_LABELS:
     ========================================
        FORMAT -> Format descriptor string used in converting the
            values from DATA into string representation.  The
            default value is '(i10)'.

        /NUMERIC -> If set, will return latitude or longitude
            labels in numerical format (e.g. "-90", "0", "+90").
            If not set, will return latitude or longitude labels
            in directional format (e.g. "90S, "0", "90N")

        /NODEGREE -> If set, will prevent the raised degree symbol
            from being appended to MAPLABEL.  Default is to add the
            raised degree symbol to MAPLABEL.

 OUTPUTS:
        LATLABEL -> String array of latitude labels

        LONLABEL -> String array of longitude labels

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines Used:
        =================================

        =================================
        STRREPL (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) LATLABEL and LONLABEL are in the range of -180..180 degrees.

        (2) We should at some point allow the user to supply individual values
            that override the default spacing.

        Requires routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        Derivation of MCF lifetime w/r/t tropospheric OH
        ----------------------------------------------------------

        We assume that MCF has a uniform mixing ratio in air (=1).  
        Thus the density of air can be substituted for the density
        of MCF in the equations below.


        The lifetime of MCF w/ respect to tropospheric OH is:

           T_OH = Atmospheric Burden / Tropospheric loss rate


        The atmospheric burden of MCF is:

           SUM{ AIRDEN(I,J,L) * VOLUME(I,J,L) }

           where:
              I        = longitudes
              J        = latitudes
              L        = levels from the surface to top of atmosphere
              AIRDEN   = Air density at ([I,J,L) in molec/cm3
              VOLUME   = Grid box volume at (I,J,L) in cm3
 

        The tropospheric loss rate of MCF is:

           SUM{ K(I,J,X) * OH(I,J,X) * AIRDEN(I,J,X) * VOLUME(I,J,X) }
    
           where
              I        = longitudes
              J        = latitudes
              X        = levels from the surface to the 
                          location of the tropopause at (I,J)
                          (we only count boxes fully in the tropopause)
              K(I,J,X) = 1.64e-12 * EXP( -1520 / T(I,J,X) )
              T(I,J,X) = Temperature at grid box (I,J,X)
   

        T_OH has several reported values in the literature:
      
           (a) Spivakovsky et al (2000) : 5.7 years
           (b) Prinn et al (2001)       : 6.0 years

        Derivation of total MCF lifetime:
        ----------------------------------------------------------

        Once you have obtained the MCF lifetime w/r/t tropospheric
        OH, you can compute the total lifetime of MCF as:

           1/T_total = 1/T_OH + 1/T_strat + 1/T_ocean

        where 

           T_total = total lifetime of MCF in atmosphere
           T_OH    = the output of this function
           T_strat = 43 years (cf. Spivakovsky et al)
           T_ocean = 94 years (range 81-145 years, cf WMO/UNEP)

 NAME:
        MFINDFILE

 PURPOSE:
        Find all the files that match a given specification.
        MFINDFILE is a wrapper for IDL routines FILE_SEARCH 
        (v5.5 and higher) and FINDFILE (v5.4 and lower).

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        LISTING = MFINDFILE( MASK )

 INPUTS:
        FILEMASK -> a path and filename specification to look for.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        none

 OUTPUTS:
        A string list containing all the files that match the 
        specification.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Routines Required:
        ===========================
        ADD_SEPARATOR (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) For IDL 5.5+, use FILE_SEARCH to return a listing of
            files with the given path name specified by MASK.  This
            should work regardless of platform.

        (2) For IDL 5.4- running under Unix, The built-in FINDFILE() 
            function has problems on whenever a lot of files are 
            matching the file specification.  This is due to the fact 
            that filename expansion is done by the shell before 
            interpreting a command.  Too many files cause too long 
            commands which are not accepted.  This causes FINDFILE() 
            to return an empty list of candidates. (cf. www.dfanning.com)
            
            Therefore, we implement a workaround where we issue a
            "ls -1" command under the Unix shell.  This isn't 100%
            foolproof either but it's better than nothing.

        (3) For IDL 5.5- running under other operating systems,
            call the built-in IDL FINDFILE routine as usual.

 EXAMPLE:
        LIST = MFINDFILE( '~mgs/terra/chem1d/code/*.f' )

        ; returns all fortran files in Martin's chem1d directory.

 NAME:
        MULTIPANEL

 PURPOSE:
        This routine provides an easy-to-use interface to 
        IDL's !p.multi mechanism and it can be used 
        to retrieve the position vector of the next plot 
        in line (even if !p.multi is not set). You can 
        specify plot margins and a page margin in normalized 
        coordinates.
           For multi-panel plots, multipanel works in three
        stages (somewhat similar to XInterAnimate): 
        1) set up a multi-panel page by specifying the number
           of rows and columns or the maximum number of plots
           on the page.
        2) advance to the next plot position and return that 
           position. If the page was filled (i.e. the maximum
           number of plots (advance steps) has been made, it 
           will be erased (unless /NOERASE is set).
        3) turn the multi-panel environment off and reset margin
           values.
        Subsequent PLOT, MAP_SET, etc. commands should use the
        POSITION vector returned from this routine and they should
        use the /NOERASE keyword.

        Turn multi-panel environment off (reset !p.multi and some other
        parameters)
        MULTIPANEL,/OFF

 INPUTS:
     Optionally you can give the number of plots (keyword NPLOTS) as
     a parameter instead. Th euse of a parameter will override the
     keyword.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        General keywords (honored under all circumstances)
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        POSITION -> Returns a 4-element vector with the position of
            the next plot in the line. As always this vector contains
            [X0,Y0,X1,Y1].

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized 
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible" 
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in subsequent plot
            commands.
            MARGIN can either be one value which will be applied to
            all four margins, or a 2-element vector which results in
            equal values for the left and right and equal values for 
            the bottom and top margins, or a 4-element vector with
            [left,bottom,right,top]. 

        OMARGIN -> specify a page margin around all panels in normalized
            coordinates. Works like MARGIN.
            
        Note that you can change the values of MARGIN and OMARGIN after
        you set up your plot page. The values given with MARGIN and OMARGIN 
        remain active until you specify a new one or use the /OFF keyword.

        /NOERASE -> This keyword prevents erasing the screen (or page) 
            when setting a multi-panel environment or after a page was
            filled. NOERASE is automatically turned ON when the /OFF
            keyword is given.


        Informational keywords:
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

        FIRSTPANEL -> returns 1 if the current plotting panel is
            the first one on a page

        LASTPANEL -> returns 1 if the current plotting panel is the last
            on a page

 
        Setting up a multi-panel page:
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        ROWS, COLS -> specify the number of rows and columns
            you want on your page. If one is specified, the 
            other one must be given as well. Alternatively,
            you can use the NPLOTS keyword. 

        NPLOTS -> maximum number of plots on one page. The 
            number of rows and columns is automatically computed
            so that the plots "approach a square" and they are
            returned in the ROWS and COLS keywords. Setting
            NPLOTS to a ROWS*COLS value is equivalent to using
            ROWS and COLS. If you specify an "uneven" number
            (e.g. 5), multipanel,/advance will erase the page 
            after 5 plots instead of 6.

        /PORTRAIT -> Normally, ROWS tends to be larger than COLS
            when NPLOTS is used (e.g. 12 gives 4 rows and 3 cols).
            Use this keyword to revert this behaviour.

        /LANDSCAPE -> Make ROWS larger than COLS if necessary. This
            is the default. Thi skeyword is actually unnecessary and
            was introduced for purely aesthetic reasons (symmetry).


        Advance to the next plot:
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        /ADVANCE -> this keyword issues a hidden plot command to find
            out the position of the next plot to be made. The position
            is then returned in the POSITION keyword. The value of
            !P.MULTI[0] is increased afterwards so that you can issue
            your plot command without explicitely specifying the
            position or /NOERASE. When the maximum number of plots set
            with NPLOTS is reached, MULTIPANEL,/ADVANCE will erase the
            screen and reset the plot position to the upper left corner.

        CURPLOT -> use this keyword to advance to a specific plot position
            on the page. If you specify 0, the screen will be erased.
            CURPLOT also returns the current plot number. If you don't
            want to set the plot number but just query it, you must pass 
            an undefined variable (see procedure UNDEFINE.PRO).


        Reset the plot position (and erase the screen)
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        /RESET -> does just this.


        Turn multi-panel environment off
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        /OFF -> Overrides all other keywords. Resets !p.multi to 0.
            

 OUTPUTS:
        none.

 SUBROUTINES:
        function GET__PLOTPOSITION() issues a dummy plot command
            and returns the plot position from the ![xy].window
            variables.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        none. (example uses RECTANGLE.PRO)

 NOTES:
        Side effect: Opens a window in standard size if none was open 
        before. This happens because the next plot position is 
        determined by issuing a hidden (or dummy) plot command with
        no visible output.
        
        Make sure to use POSITION=P,/NOERASE with all your PLOT, MAP_SET
        CONTOUR, etc. commands. In fact, you don't _need_ /NOERASE for
        PLOT, but it guarantees consistent behaviour with MAP_SET etc.)
        A PLOT command without /NOERASE will advance to the next panel
        and thereby interfere with MULTIPANEL's plot counter.

        If you don't use MARGIN and OMARGIN, the values in ![XY].margin
        ![XY].omargin will take effect.

        A common block is used to store the current plot number and 
        margin information. This limits the use to one window at a time
        (although you can save all parameters elsewhere and supply them
        to the routine on a window-by-window basis).

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        MULTIPANEL, position=p
        PLOT, findgen(10), color=1, position=p, /noerase

             ; Just retrieve the position of the next plot

        (2) 
        MULTIPANEL, MARGIN=[0.1,0.05], POSITION=P
        PLOT, FINDGEN(10), COLOR=1, POSITION=P, /NOERASE

             ; same thing but use a specific margin (2-element form) 
             ;
             ; If you want to see both previous plots together use 
             ; /NOERASE with MULTIPANEL

        (3) 
        ; Set up for 5 plots
        MULTIPANEL, NPLOTS=5                     

        FOR I = 0, 4 DO BEGIN

           ; Get current plot position
           MULTIPANEL, POSITION=P, MARGIN=0.04     

           ; Do the plot
           PLOT, FINDGEN(10), COLOR=!MYCT.BLACK,$
               POSITION=P, /NOERASE   
            
           ; Go to the next panel
           ; Note that the screen would be erased after the last plot
           ; without the /NoErase keyword.;
           MULTIPANEL, /ADVANCE, /NOERASE 

        ENDFOR

             ; Multi-panel example

        (4) 
        MULTIPANEL, /OFF, OMARGIN=0.01, MARGIN=0., $
            POSITION=P, /NOERASE 
        RECTANGLE, P, XVEC, YVEC        
        PLOTS, XVEC, YVEC, COLOR=!MYCT.BLACK, /NORM

 NAME:
        MULTISORT

 PURPOSE:
        hierarchical sorting of a data set, each column can be sorted
        reversely. Works well together with W_SORT, a widget interface 
        that handles up to three sort levels/columns. COLUMNS are defined
        as first array index (e.g. DATA=FLTARR(5,20) has 5 columns).

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        multisort,data,index=index,revert=revert

 INPUTS:
        DATA --> a 2D array to be sorted

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        INDEX --> an integer or integer array containing the indices for
            which the array shall be sorted (e.g. [ 3,1,0 ] will sort DATA
            first by column 3, then within groups of same values for column
            3 values will be sorted by column 1, and finally by column 0.
            Default is to sort by the first column.

        REVERT --> an integer or integer array indicating which columns shall
            be sorted in reverse order. REVERT=1 reverts all sorting,
            REVERT=[0,1,0] reverts the sort order only for the 2nd column.
            Default is 0, i.e. do not revert.


 OUTPUTS:
        The DATA array will be sorted according to the specifications.

 SUBROUTINES:
        testsort : little test program (historic debugging purposes)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        MULTISORT, DATA, INDEX=[3,1,0], REVERT=[0,1,0]

             ; Sort data first in column 3, then in reverse order 
             ; for column 1, and finally ascending order for column 0.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 30 Jun 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 08 Apr 1998: - now stand-alone routine and documentation
        mgs, 22 Dec 1998: - bug fix (startindex must be -1)
        mgs, 17 Mar 1999: - bug fix: now has default 0 for revert

 NAME:
        MYCT

 PURPOSE:
        Define a set of standard drawing colors and load a colortable 
        on top of these.  The color table can be manipulated in various 
        ways (see KEYWORD PARAMETERS).

        The standard MYCT drawing colors are as follows.  These
        were implemented by Chris Holmes, based on the ColorBrewer 
        definitions.  These colors are less saturated than the 
        traditional MYCT drawing colors, and are easier to read
        on the screen:

           0 : white              9 : lightblue
           1 : black             10 : lightorange
           2 : red               11 : lightpurple
           3 : green             12 : 85% grey
           4 : blue              13 : 67% grey
           5 : orange            14 : 50% grey
           6 : purple            15 : 33% grey
           7 : lightred          16 : 15% grey
           8 : lightgreen        17 : white

        However, if you use the /BRIGHT_COLORS keyword to MYCT, you
        may still use the traditional MYCT drawing colors (which were
        created by Martin Schultz).  These are defined as follows:

           0 : white             9  : lightgreen
           1 : black             10 : lightblue
           2 : red               11 : black
           3 : green             12 : 85% grey
           4 : blue              13 : 67% grey
           5 : yellow            14 : 50% grey
           6 : magenta           15 : 33% grey
           7 : cyan              16 : 15% grey
           8 : lightred          17 : white
         
        With MYCT, you may load any of the standard IDL color tables
        or any of the ColorBrewer color tables.  For backwards
        compatibility, MYCT also supports several customized color
        tables that used to be defined with the CUSTOM_COLORTABLE
        routine.

        MYCT reads color table definitions from an IDL *.tbl file.
        The default file name is "gamap_colors.tbl".  You may specify
        a different file with the CTFILE keyword (see below).  Also,
        if you wish to add a custom color table, the best way to 
        proceed is to create your own *.tbl file with your custom
        color table definitions.  See the routine GAMAP_COLORS for
        more information.

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MYCT, [ TABLE ] [ , keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        TABLE (optional) -> Number or name of the IDL color table 
             to be used.  If no number or name is provided, the
             routine will default to color table 0 (which for the 
             "gamap_colors.tbl" file is B-W LINEAR).  The MYCT
             drawing colors will be loaded first, and the color
             table will be loaded on top of that.  You can choose
             the bottom color index for the color table with the
             BOTTOM keyword.  MYCT will ensures that the system
             variable !D.N_COLORS is set correctly.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /BRIGHT_COLORS -> Selects the older set of MYCT drawing colors
             to be loaded at the bottom of the colortable.  Default is 
             to select the newer set of MYCT drawing colors, which
             are less saturated and easier to read on the screen.

        BOTTOM -> specify where to start color table (see BOTTOM keyword
             in LOADCT). Default is number of standard drawing colors+1
             or 0 (if NO_STD is set). If BOTTOM is less than the number
             of standard drawing colors (17), no standard colors will be
             defined (equivalent to setting NO_STD).  RANGE has no
             effect on the DIAL/LIDAR colortable.  Default is 18.
             NOTE: You should not normally have to change this value.

        CTFILE -> Specify a file containing the color table
             definitions.  Default is "gamap_colors.tbl", which is
             a combination of the standard IDL color tables plus
             the ColorBrewer color tables.  (See routine GAMAP_COLORS.)

        NCOLORS -> number of color indices to be used by the color table.
             Default is !D.N_COLORS-BOTTOM. 

        /NO_STD -> prevents definition of standard drawing colors.

        RANGE -> a two element vector which specifies the range of colors
             from the color table to be used (fraction 0-1). The colortable
             is first loaded into the complete available space, then
             the selected portion is interpolated in order to achieve the
             desired number of colors.   RANGE is only effective when
             a TABLE parameter is given.  RANGE has no effect on the 
             customized colortables.

        /REVERSE -> Set this switch to reverse the color table.
             /REVERSE works for both IDL and custom color tables.

        SATURATION -> factor to scale saturation values of the extra
             color table. Saturation ranges from 0..1 (but the factor 
             is free choice as long as positive).  SATURATION has no
             effect on the customized colortables.  Default is 1.

        USERDEF -> set to load the user defined colortable. The table
             is defined in the Define_UserDef routine. It can be
             loaded in three different ways:
                  MyCt, -1
                  MyCt, /user
                  MyCt, 'user'
             In the later version, the string is not case sensitive,
             and can be any string that contains the word "user".
               
        VALUE -> factor to scale the "value" of the added colortable.
             (i.e. this is like the contrast knobon a TV set).  Value 
             ranges from 0..1; 0 = black, 1 = white.  Default is 1.

        /USE_CURRENT -> By default, MYCT will reset the color table
             to all white before loading a new colortable.  Set
             /USE_CURRENT to prevent this from happening.

        /VERBOSE -> Set this switch to print out information about
             the color table that has just been selected.

        /XINTERACTIVE -> to call XLOADCT instead of LOADCT for
             interactivity. Has no effect if a custom colortable is
             loaded.


        The following keywords are kept for backwards compatibility.
        These will replicate the color tables that used to be defined
        with the now obsolete CUSTOM_COLORTABLE routine.
        
        /BuWhRd   -> Loads 19-color BLUE-WHITE-RED color table
        /BuWhWhRd -> Loads 20-color BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED color table
        /BuYlRd   -> Loads 11-color BLUE-YELLOW-RED color table
        /BuYlYlRd -> Loads 12-color BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED color table
        /DIAL     -> Loads the 26-color DIAL/LIDAR color table 
                      (cf. E. Browell)
        /DIFF     -> Synonym for /BuWhRd.  
        /ModSpec  -> Loads the 11 color MODIFIED SPECTRUM color table
        /WhBu     -> Loads the 10-color WHITE-BLUE color table
        /WhGrYlRd -> Loads the 20-color WHITE_GREEN-YELLOW-RED color table
                      (cf. Aaron van Donkelaar)
        /WhGyBk   -> Loads the 10-color the WHITE-GRAY-BLACK color
        /WhRd     -> Loads the 10-color the WHITE-RED color table

            all devices.  In order to get 256 colors on a postscript 
            printer use DEVICE,/COLOR,BITS_PER_PIXEL=8 

        (2) MYCT will also save several parameters in the MYCT system 
            variable, so that graphics programs can access them.

        (3) MYCT uses the "gamap_colors.tbl" file.  This file
            contains all of the IDL standard color table definitions
            all of the olorBrewer color table definitions, and some
            extra colortables.  If you wish to add a color table
            you should probably use routine GAMAP_COLORS to create
            a new *.tbl file.  Then call MYCT and specify the name
            of the new *.tbl file with the CTFILE keyword.

        (4) We will use the ColorBrewer color abbreviations:
               Bk = Black    Br = Brown    Bu = Blue      
               Gr = Green    Gy = Gray     Or = Orange    
               Pi = Pink     Pu = Purple   Rd = Red     
               Wh = White    Yl = Yellow

        (5) An MS Excel spreadsheet with all ColorBrewer color tables 
            is available for download from:
            www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/ColorBrewer_RGB.html

        (6) NOTE: Use a temporary hack to center the ColorBrewer
            diverging color tables. (phs, 4/23/08)

 EXAMPLES:
        MYCT, 8, /NO_STD     
             ; load IDL colortable green-white (#8)
             ; identical result as loadct,3

        MYCT, 'EOS B', NCOLORS=20  
             ; change first 17 colors to standard drawing colors
             ; and add EOS-B (#27) color table in indices 18-36

        MYCT, 0, NCOLORS=20, /REVERSE, /NO_STD, /Use_Current
             ; add reversed grey scale table on top

        MYCT, 'EOS B', NCOLORS=40, /NO_STD, /Use_Current, $
             RANGE=[0.1,0.7], SATURATION=0.7
             ; add a less saturated version of a fraction
             ; of the EOS-B color table in the next 40 indices
             ; NOTE that color indices above 97 will still contain 
             ; the upper portion of the green-white color table.

        MYCT, 0 /REVERSE     
             ; On b/w terminals MYCT can be used to reverse
             ; the IDL black & white (#0) colortable 

        MYCT, /DIAL, NCOLORS=120
            ; Loads the DIAL LIDAR color table with 120 colors

        MYCT, /BuYlYlRd
        MYCT, 'RdBu', /MIDCOLORPRESENT, /YELLOW, NCOLORS=20
            ; Both of these commands do the same thing: loads
            ; the ColorBrewer "RdBu" colortable and inserts yellow
            ; into the 2 middle colors.  This is a good choice
            ; if you are creating an absolute or % difference plot.

 NAME:
        MYCT_DEFAULTS (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Returns a structure associating the names of MYCT
        drawing colors with their numeric values, plus
        the default bottom and number of colors. 

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        C = MYCT_DEFAULTS()

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /GRAYSCALE -> If set, will define a grayscale colortable
             such that the lowest color is white, and the highest
             color is dark grey.  Otherwise the standard "TRACE-P"
             colortable (based on Mac Style #25) will be defined.

        NCOLORS -> Specifies the number of colors for MYCT.  The
             default is 120, but if your terminal can support more,
             you may specify a higher value.

 OUTPUTS:
        C -> Structure with the following tag names:
             WHITE       : Color index for "drawing color" WHITE
             BLACK       : Color index for "drawing color" BLACK

             FILE        : Name of the color table (*.tbl) file
             NAME        : Color table name
             INDEX       : Color table index 
             BOTTOM      : Color table starts at this index
             NCOLORS     : Number of colors
             RANGE       : Range of IDL color table to be used
             SAT         : Saturation value for MYCT
             VALUE       : Hue value for MYCT
             REVERSE     : REVERSE=1 means light --> dark
                           REVERSE=0 means dark  --> light

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Designed to be used by the GAMAP routine "myct.pro".

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine is designed to be called by MYCT_DEFINE.
        You should not normally have to call MYCT_DEFAULTS.

        (2) MYCT defines a colortable such that the first 17
        colors are "drawing" colors, or pure colors intended
        for use with the PLOT, CONTOUR, MAP_SET, etc. commands.
        MYCT then loads a standard IDL colortable (with NCOLORS
        specifying the number of individual colors) into color
        indices 18  and higher.

        (3) New drawing colors (that are less saturated and
        easier to read on the screen) are now the defaults.
        See the documentation to the MYCT routine for more info.

 EXAMPLE:
        C = MYCT_DEFAULTS()

            ; Defines a grayscale colortable for use w/ MYCT.
            

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

                          - adapted from "default_colors.pro"
        bmy, 04 Feb 2004: TOOLS VERSION 2.01
                          - Increased grayscale color range slightly
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - renamed DIAL to CUSTOM, to reflect that
                            we have other custom colortables in use
  cdh & bmy, 19 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                          - Added names for the new MYCT drawing colors
        bmy, 21 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Removed obsolete settings and keywords
                          - Removed IS_CUSTOM tag name from !MYCT
                          - Added INDEX, FILE tag names to !MYCT

 NAME:
        NCDF_GET

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to read data into netCDF format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DATA = NCDF_GET( FID, NAME [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        FID -> netCDF File ID, as returned by routine NCDF_OPEN.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved 
             to the netCDF file.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        VARINFO -> Returns a structure containing information
             about the variable read in from disk.  The structure
             has the following form:

             { NAME      : "", $
               DATATYPE  : "", $
               NDIMS     : 0L, $

        Uses the following IDL netCDF routines:
        ========================================
        NCDF_VarId   (function)  NCDF_VarGet
        NCDF_VarInfo (function)  NCDF_AttGet
        NCDF_AttName (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ netCDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) Only looks for the "long_name", "unit", and "valid_range"
            attributes.  The user can extend this as he/she desires.
            For a more general program, see ~/IDL/tools/ncdf_read.pro
            by Martin Schultz.

 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define array to write to file
        ARRAY = DIST( 100, 50 )

        ; Find out if netCDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( NCDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'netCDF not supported!'

        ; Open netCDF file and get the file ID # (FID)
        FID   = NCDF_OPEN( 'myfile.nc' )
        IF ( FID lt 0 ) then Message, 'Error opening file!'

        ; Read data from the netCDF file
        ; Return data attributes in the VARINFO array
        ; Also returns the text from the UNIT string
        DATA = NCDF_GET( FID, 'BIOBSRCE::NOx', $
                         VARINFO=VARINFO, UNIT=UNIT ) 

        ; Close the netCDF file
        NCDF_CLOSE, FID

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        NCDF_READ

 PURPOSE:
        Open a netCDF file and read data from it. The data is 
        returned as a structure whose tag names are the names of 
        the variables with blanks etc. replaced. If no variables 
        are specified with the VARIABLES keyword, only dimensional 
        information is returned. You can load all variables using
        the ALL keyword. Other keyword options include OFFSET, COUNT, STRIDE,
        NO_DIMENSIONS, NO_STRUCT, DIMNAMES, VARNAMES, VARDIMS, ATTRIBUTES.
        Thus, this program includes ncdump functionality.
        If no filename is given, a file selection dialog is
        opened with the default mask '*.nc'. The name of the selected
        file is returned in the TRUENAME keyword. A file selection
        dialog also appears when the file cannot be found (see
        OPEN_FILE.PRO). This can be turned off with the NO_DIALOG
        keyword. The VERBOSE keyword provides information while
        analyzing and reading the file.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_READ, result, filename=<string>, truename=<string>,
            variables=<stringarray>, all=<flag>, varnames=<stringarray>, 
            vardimid=<structure>, vardims=<structure>, attributes=<structure>,
            count=<integerarray>, offset=<integerarray>, stride=<integerarray>, 
            dimnames=<stringarray>, dims=<longarray>, no_dimensions=<flag>,
            no_struct=<flag>, no_dialog=<flag>, verbose=<flag>, title=<string>

 ARGUMENTS:
        RESULT(out) -> a structure containing all the variable data
             from the netCDF file. If only one variable is specified 
             and the NO_STRUCT keyword set, then RESULT will be an
             array instead of a structure. Use the ALL keyword
             to load all variables at once. Note, that the COUNT, OFFSET,
             and STRIDE keywords can affect the size of RESULT.
             RESULT is set to -1L if an error occurs before the structure
             has been built. You can use CHKSTRU.PRO to test for this.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME(in) -> the name of the netCDF file to be opened.
             NCDF_READ uses OPEN_FILE to check the validity of
             the file first. You can specify a search mask
             instead of a filename in which case a file selection
             dialog is displayed (unless you set the NO_DIALOG
             keyword). The TRUENAME keyword contains the name
             of the selected file or an empty string if the
             file selection was canceled.

        TRUENAME(out) -> the (fully qualified) name of the file selected
             with the file selection dialog or an unaltered copy
             of FILENAME if FILENAME is a valid filename.

        VARIABLES(in) -> a string array containing the names of variables
             for which data shall be read. Default is to read 
             only the dimensional information from the file. 
             (Currently) no warning is issued if a variable is not in the file.

        ALL(in) -> set this keyword to load all variables stored in the 
             netCDF file. Generally, you cannot usethis keyword together with
             COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE.

        VARNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of all variables 
             as stored in the file. Note, that the tag names of e.g. the
             result structure are filtered with the Valid_TagName function.
             
        VARDIMID(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimension ID's for all variables. See also VARDIMS which returns
             the dimensions themselves.

        VARDIMS(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimensions for all variables in the netCDF file. These are not
             kept in sync with potential COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE values,
             but reflect the data sizes as stored in the file.

        ATTRIBUTES(out) -> a structure holding the variable and global
             attributes stored in the netCDF file (global attributes
             are stored in tag name GLOBAL). 

        COUNT(in) -> an integer array containing the number of values to
             be read for each dimension of the variables. Mapping of the
             COUNT dimensions to the variable dimensions is achieved via
             the first entry in the VARIABLES list and the COUNT parameter
             will be applied to all variables that have that dimension. 
             Example: The first variable has dimensions LON, LAT, LEV,
             the second variable has dimensions LON, LAT, and the third
             variable has LAT, LEV. A COUNT of [40,20,10] would lead to
             result dimensions of [40,20,10], [40,20], and [20,10].

        OFFSET(in) -> an integer array containing the offsets for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.

        STRIDE(in) -> an integer array containing the stride for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.
             
        DIMNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of the 
             dimensions stored in the netCDF file.

        DIMS(out) -> a long array containing the dimension values. Purely
             for convenience. Use VARDIMS to retrieve the dimensions of
             the variables.

        TITLE(in) -> A title for the file selection dialog if an
             incomplete or incorrect filename is specified. This
             keyword is ignored if the no_dialog keyword is set.

        NO_DIMENSIONS(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want to store
             the dimensional variables from the file in the result structure. 
             DIMNAMES and DIMS will still be retrieved.

        NO_STRUCT(in) -> if only one variable is selected with the
             VARIABLE keyword, you can set this keyword to return only
             the data for this variable as an array. This keyword implies
             the functionality of NO_DIMENSIONS.

        NO_DIALOG(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want interactive 
             behaviour when a file mask is given instead of a filename or
             when the specified file does not exist.

        VERBOSE(in) -> set this keyword to get detailed information while
             reading the netCDF file.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Valid_TagName : replaces invalid characters in variable names so that
            a structure can be built.
      
        ncdf_attributes : retrieves global and variable attributes from netcdf
            file and stores them as structure.

        ncdf_dimensions : retrieves size and name for all dimensions in netcdf file.

        ncdf_varnames : retrieves names and dimension information for all variables
            in the netCDF file.

        ncdf_mapdims : map dimension indices for COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE with 
            dimensions of first selected variable.

        ncdf_TestDimensions : compute the COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE vectors that
            must be applied for retrieving the data of one variable.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses OPEN_FILE and STRREPL.

 NOTES:
        Correct handling of dimensional information requires that the variables
        storing the dimension values have the same name as the dimensions
        themselves - a common feature in most netCDF standards.

        I am still working on a netcdf file object which will be even
        more powerful. At some point ncdf_read will only be a
        procedure interface to this objec!

 EXAMPLE:
        ncdf_read,result,/All
        ; plot ozone vs. temperature
        plot,result.temperature,result.ozone

 NAME:
        NCDF_SET

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to write data into netCDF format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_SET, FID, DATA, NAME, DIMS [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FID -> netCDF File ID, as returned by routine NCDF_CREATE.

        DATA -> Data (array or scalar) to be written to netCDF file.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved 
             to the netCDF file.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LONGNAME -> Longer descriptive name for the data.  
             This will be saved as the "long_name" attribute.  

        RANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the [min,max] of
             the data array.  If not passed, RANGE will be computed
             (but only if DATA is a numeric type).  RANGE is saved 
             to the netCDF file as the "valid_range" attribute.

        UNIT -> String containing the units of the data. 
             This will be saved as the "unit" attribute.       

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses the following routines:
        =====================================================
        NCDF_Control    NCDF_VarDef     (function)
        NCDF_AttPut     DATATYPE        (function from TOOLS)
        NCDF_VarPut     NCDF_VALID_NAME (function from TOOLS)   

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ netCDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) For now, treat BYTE data like CHAR data.  This is
            most likely since netCDF does not support STRING types,
            strings have to be stored as arrays of bytes.

 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define array to write to file
        ARRAY = DIST( 100, 50 )

        ; Find out if netCDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( NCDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'netCDF not supported!'

        ; Open netCDF file and get the file ID # (FID)
        FID = NCDF_CREATE( 'myfile.nc', /CLOBBER )
        IF ( FID lt 0 ) then Message, 'Error opening file!'

        ; Set dimensions for netCDF file
        S    = SIZE( ARRAY, /DIM ) 
        DIM1 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Length', S[0] )
        DIM2 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Width',  S[1] )

        ; Go into netCDF DATA mode
        NCDF_CONTROL, FID, /ENDEF

        ; Call NCDF_SET to write the array to the file
        NCDF_SET, FID, ARRAY, 'My Data', [ DIM1, DIM2 ], $
                  LONGNAME='Data array created by me!',  $
                  UNIT='unitless'

        ; Close the netCDF file
        NCDF_CLOSE, FID

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 19 Apr 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.50
        bmy, 10 Sep 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.51
                          - Now call routine DATATYPE to determine
                            the type of the data so that we can
                            write to the netCDF file appropriately
                          - Don't add the RANGE attribute to
                            the netCDF file for a string type value.
                          - Updated comments 
        bmy, 21 Oct 2003: TOOLS VERSION 1.53
                          - now "sanitize" the netCDF variable name
                            w/ routine NCDF_VALID_NAME.  The new netCDF
                            library in IDL 6.0+ chokes on bad characters.

 NAME:
        NCDF_VALID_NAME

 PURPOSE:
        Strips invalid characters from a string which is to be
        used as a netCDF variable name.  Based on original code
        by Martin Schultz.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( ARG )

 INPUTS:
        ARG -> netCDF variable name string to be examined.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> New netCDF name string with "bad" characters
             replaced by "good" characters.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Used:
        ==========================
        STRREPL (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        In IDL 6.0+, the netCDF library has been updated.  Some
        characters which used to be allowed in netCDF variable names
        are no longer allowed.  Therefore, use this function to
        replace "bad" characters with "good" characters when 
        reading or writing to/from netCDF files.

 EXAMPLE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( 'IJ-AVG-$::CO' )
        PRINT, RESULT

             ; Prints "IJ-AVG-S__CO"

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Number density of air in molec/cm3.  If T and 
             P are vectors, then RESULT will be a vector of
             number densities

 NAME:
        NYMD2TAU (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Computes the value of TAU, which is the elapsed hours between

        the starting date for 3D model data assimilation.

 CATEGORY:
        Date & Time

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = NYMD2TAU( NYMD, [NHMS [,NYMD0, NHMS0]] )

 INPUTS:
        NYMD (long)  -> YY/MM/DD for this date (e.g. 940101)
                  You can either specify year as 4 digits or 2 digits.
                  With 2 digits, year < 50 will be assumed to be 2000+YY.A

        NHMS (long)  -> HH/MM/SS for this date (e.g. 060000)
                  will be defaulted to 000000

        NYMD0 (long) -> YY/MM/DD for the start of the epoch
                  default is {19}850101 which is the GEOS-1 start

        NHMS0 (long) -> HH/MM/SS for the start of the epoch
                  will be defaulted to 000000
        
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /GEOS1 -> use 1985/01/01 as epoch start

        /GISS_II -> use 1980/01/01 as epoch start

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The function returns the TAU value as a 
             double-precision number

 SUBROUTINES:
        NYMD2STRU : extracts year, month, day, hour, minute and seconds from
            NYMD and NHMS values.

 NOTES:
        Function NYMD2STRU is also contained in function TAU2YYMMDD.
        Take care when changes are necessary !

 EXAMPLE:
        ; (1) Compute TAU value for 0h on Jan 1, 1994, with the 
        ;     epoch starting on 0h on Jan 1, 1980 (GISS II value).
        ;
        TAU = nymd2tau( 940101L, 0L, 800101L, 0L )

                            special Y2K treatment of dates (i.e.
                            treat dates w/ 2 digits as from 1900's)
                          - renamed internal function NYMD2STRU to
                            N2T_NYMD2STRU to avoid conflict with
                            similar function in "tau2yymmdd.pro"

 NAME:
        OPEN_DEVICE

 PURPOSE:
        If hard copy is to be generated, OPEN_DEVICE opens the 
        PostScript device.  Otherwise OPEN_DEVICE opens an Xwindow. 

 CATEGORY:
        Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        OPEN_DEVICE [,OLD_DEVICE] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        OLD_DEVICE -> This is now obsolete, and is only maintained
             for backwards compatibility.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /PS -> will send PostScript file to printer

        FILENAME -> The name to be given the PostScript file.
             Default: idl.ps

        /LANDSCAPE  -> will enable PostScript landscape mode

        /PORTRAIT -> will enable PostScript portrait mode

        XOFFSET, YOFFSET -> Keywords for the DEVICE command.  XSIZE
             specifies the horizontal offset (in inches) of the page,
             and YSIZE specifies the vertical offset (in inches) of
             the page.  Defaults are as follows:

             Plot type         XOFFSET          YOFFSET

             -------------------------------------------------
             Portrait           0.25             0.25
             Landscape          0.75             0.75
             
        XSIZE, YSIZE -> Keywords for the DEVICE command.  XSIZE
             specifies the horizontal size (in inches) of the page,
             and YSIZE specifies the vertical size (in inches) of
             the page.  Defaults are as follows:
             
             Plot type         XSIZE            YSIZE
             -------------------------------------------------
             Portrait           8.0              10.0
             Landscape      11 - 2*XOFFSET   8.5 - 2*YOFFSET


        /COLOR -> will enable PostScript color mode

        WINPARAM -> An integer vector with up to 5 elements:
             WINPARAM(0) = window number  (if negative, a window
                          will be opened with the /FREE option.
             WINPARAM(1) = X dimension of window in pixels (width)
             WINPARAM(2) = Y dimension of window in pixels (height)
             WINPARAM(3) = X offset of window (XPOS)
             WINPARAM(4) = Y offset of window (YPOS)

        TITLE -> window title

        /Z -> If set, will initialize the Z-buffer device.  If WINPARAM
             is specified, then the size of the Z-buffer region will be
             WINPARAM[1] x WINPARAM[2] pixels.  If WINPARAM is not 
             specified, then the size of the Z-buffer region will be 
             set to a default size of 640 x 512 pixels.

        NCOLORS -> If /Z is set, NCOLORS specifies the number of colors
             that will be made available to the Z-buffer device.
         
        _EXTRA=e -> additional keywords that are passed to the call to
             the DEVICE routine (e.g. /ENCAPSULATED)

 OUTPUTS:
        OLD_DEVICE -> stores the previous value of !D.NAME for
             use in CLOSE_DEVICE. Note that CLOSE_DEVICE will automatically
             set the default screen device if OLD_DEVICE is not provided,
             hence it will only rarely be used.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        If PS=0 then  
            Open Xwindow WINPARAM(0), which is WINPARAM(1) pixels wide
            in the X-direction, and WINPARAM(2) pixels wide in the
            Y-direction. 

        If PS=1 then 
           depending on /PORTRAIT or /LANDSCAPE and /COLOR
           postscript is enabled in either portrait or landscape
           mode as color or b/w plot

        The key parameter which determines whether to open a postscript
        file or a screen window is PS. Therefore, e.g. in a widget 
        application, you can pass a standard set of parameters for both,
        postscript and screen, to this routine, and determine the device
        to be chosen by a button state or checkbox which is passed into PS.
              
        Also is currently hardwired for 8.5 x 11 inch paper (US
        format).  Need to extend this to European A4 paper soon.
        

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        OPEN_DEVICE, WINPARAM=[0,800,800]  

             ; opens a screen window of size 800x800 
             ; pixels at the default position

        (2)
        OPEN_DEVICE, /LANDSCAPE, FILENAME='myplot.ps'

             ; opens a postscript file named myplot.ps in 
             ; b/w and landscape orientation

        (3)
        OPEN_DEVICE, PS=PS, /PORTRAIT, /COLOR, WIN=2

             ; depending on the value of PS either a color 
             ; postscript file named idl.ps is opened or screen 
             ; window number 2 in default size.

        (4)
        OPEN_DEVICE, /Z

             ; Opens the IDL Z-buffer device.  The current 
             ; color table will be preserved in the Z-buffer device.

 NAME:
        OPEN_FILE

 PURPOSE:
        Open a file for input. This routine can automatically
        decide whether to use DIALOG_PICKFILE, and it contains
        basic error handling. After successful operation the
        file with logical unit LUN will be open for input.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        OPEN_FILE,filemask,lun [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILEMASK -> a filename with path information that may
            contain wildcards ('*', '?')

        LUN -> a named variable that will contain the logical unit
            number upon return. If a unit number > 0 is passed,
            an attempt is made to open the file with this number,
            otherwise, a free unit is selected with /GET_LUN. In case
            of an error, LUN contains -1. This can be used instead of
            the RESULT keyword to detect errors (see below).

        (both parameters are mandatory !)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> a named variable that will contain the complete
            filename upon return (i.e. the file selected with PICKFILE)

        WRITE -> Set this keyword to open a file for read and write
            operations. Normally, a file is opened for reading only.

        RESULT -> a named variable that will return the error status
            of the operation. A value of 0 indicates the file was
            opened sucessfully, otherwise the value of !Error_State.Code
            is returned.

        PICKFILE -> logical flag to force use of the DIALOG_PICKFILE
            routine, even if a complete filemask without wildcards was
            passed.

        TITLE -> the title of the pickfile dialog. Default is
            'Choose a file'.

        DEFAULTMASK -> A default filemask to be used when no filename
            is given or the filename does not contain wildcards and
            /PICKFILE is set. This mask will also be used if the
            file cannot be opened because of 'FILE NOT FOUND' error.

        NO_PICKFILE -> prevents the pickfile dialog for batch operation.
            The filemask must not contain wildcards.
            Normally a 'FILE NOT FOUND' condition leads to
            a second attempt with the /PICKFILE flag set (recursive
            call). Use this flag if you want to abort instead.

        _EXTRA keywords are passed to the openr routine
            (e.g. /F77_UNFORMATTED)

 OUTPUTS:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses EXTRACT_FILENAME function

                            modified
        mgs, 14 Aug 1998: - small bug fix: handle empty filename
                            string correctly
        mgs, 22 Aug 1998: - added WRITE keyword to open writable files
        mgs, 22 Oct 1998: - now always returns LUN=-1 in case of an error
        mgs, 21 Jan 1999: - Added explicit F77_Unformatted keyword and set
                            Swap_If_Little_Endian or Swap_If_Big_Endian  
                            automatically
        mgs, 10 Feb 1999: - bug fix: swap_if was wrong way round
        mgs, 12 May 1999: - ok. finally got the hang of byte swapping! 
                            It's the machine architecture not the operating
                            system!  Now changed it so that !VERSION.ARCH is
                            tested for 'x86'
        mgs, 20 May 1999: - abandoned SWAP_IF completely and use explicit
                            SWAP_ENDIAN keyword in users grace now.

                            manually reset it to './'.  This will avoid
                            the contents of the !PATH variable from being
                            listed in the dialog box.

                          - declare dummy GET_LUN keyword. It
                            prevents passing GET_LUN w/ _extra to
                            openr/w, since LUN is already assigned in
                            all cases.

 NAME:
        ORG_CORR

 PURPOSE:
        Calculate reduced major axis.  Given two vectors X and Y, this
        subroutine computes the Gradient and Y intercept of the line 
        given by the reduced major axis.  The main advantage of this 
        is that the best fit line of X and Y will be the same as the 
        best fit line of Y and X.

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        ORG_CORR, X, Y, R, NP, GRADIENT, INTERCEPT,            $
                  GRADIENT_ERR, INTERCEPT_ERR [, VERBOSE=VERBOSE ]

 INPUTS:
        X -> Vector containing X-axis values.

        Y -> Vector containing Y-axis values.

        R -> Correlation coefficient
 
        NP -> Number of elements of X and Y arrays to process. 
             NP should be smaller than or equal to the number of
             elements of X and Y.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /VERBOSE -> Set this switch to print the gradient,
             intercept, and standard errors to the screen.   
             The default is not to print these values.

 OUTPUTS:
        GRADIENT -> Gradient of reduced major axis

        INTERCEPT -> Y-Intercept of reduced major axis
  
        GRADIENT_ERR -> Standard error in gradient.

        INTERCEPT_ERR -> Standard error in Y-intercept.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:

        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The vector of pressures at level edges [hPa]

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The relationship between sigma centers and sigma edges is
        as follows:
   
              MID[N] = ( EDGE[N] + EDGE[N+1] ) / 2
   
        or conversely:
    
              EDGE[N+1] = ( 2 * MID[N] ) - EDGE[N]
   
        where EDGE[N] is the lower pressure edge, and EDGE[N+1]
        is the upper sigma edge of the box with center MID[N].
          
        The boundary condition PE[0] = PSURF is necessary to
        start the iteration.
      
 EXAMPLE:
        RESULT = PEDGE( [ 900, 700, 500 ], 1000.0 ) 
        PRINT, RESULT
           1000.00      800.000      600.000      400.000

             ; Prints edges between levels 900, 700, 500 hPa
             ; with the surface pressure being 1000 hPa.

 NAME:
        PERCENTILES

 PURPOSE:
        Compute percentiles of a data array (both ways: data that
        correspond to %, and % that correspond to data)

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Y = PERCENTILES( DATA [,VALUE=value-array] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> the vector containing the data

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
 
        VALUE --> array or scalar that specify percentile(s) to
             compute.  If /REVERSE is set, a percentage that
             correspond to Value is return.
             
             Default percentile to compute is standard set of min
             (0%), 25%, median (=50%), 75%, and max(100%) which can
             be used for box- and whisker plots.  The values in the
             VALUE array must lie between 0. and 1.

             If /REVERSE, default value is mean(data) 

        INTERPOLATE --> Behaves like EVEN keyword for MEDIAN. 
             If no element of the data falls exactly on the requested
             percentile value, then the 2 adjacent data elements are 
             linearly interpolated to the requested percentile value.
             When using the INTERPOLATE keyword, returned values may
             not be elements of the input array. 
             
        /NAN  --> if set, ignores NaN values. You must use that
                  keyword if your dataset may have NaN.
        
        /REVERSE --> to get % corresponding to data value, instead of
                    data corresponding to %

 OUTPUTS:
        Y -> The function returns an array with the percentile 
             values or -1 if no data was passed or value contains 
             invalid numbers.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
      x = (findgen(31)-15.)*0.2     ; create sample data
      y = exp(-x^2)/3.14159         ; compute some Gauss distribution
      p = percentiles(y,value=[0.05,0.1,0.9,0.95])
      print,p

      IDL prints :  3.92826e-05  0.000125309     0.305829     0.318310

 NAME:
        PLOT_GPROF

 PURPOSE:
        Reads a GNU Profile (gprof) text output and creates a bar graph
        of how long subroutines take to execute.  This is useful in
        examining code for computational bottlenecks.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        PLOT_GPROF, FILENAME [,keywords]

 INPUTS
        FILENAME -> Text file containing profiling output from gprof.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        N_DISPLAY -> The number of routines to display, from slowest
             to fastest.  The default is 30.

        BARCOLOR -> The color table value that will be used to plot
             the bars.  Default is !MYCT.RED.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print a listing of the N_DISPLAY
             slowest routines.  The routine name, execution time, 
             and percentage of total run time will be printed.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None
        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses these GAMAP routines
        ==========================
        STRPAD   (function)  
        STRRIGHT (function)   

 NOTES:
       For instructions on using the GNU Profiler (gprof) and creating
       a text file with profiling output, please see this wiki page:
       http://wiki.geos-chem.org/Profiling_GEOS-Chem.

 EXAMPLE:
        PLOT_GPROF, 'Profile_Gfortran_Intel.txt', N_DISPLAY=40, /VERBOSE

             ; Creates a bar plot showing the 40 slowest routines
             ; contained in the GNU profiler output file named
             ; "Profile_Gfortran_Intel.txt".  Also will print the
             ; profiling info to the screen.

        Plots the evolution of total mass vs. time from the
        geosfp_2x25_masscons simulation.
       
 CATEGORY
        Benchmarking

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        PLOT_MASSCONS, FILENAME, _EXTRA=e

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file containing the total mass
             printed every 6 hours from the geosfp_2x25_masscons

        ===============================
        NYMD2TAU   (function)
        STRBREAK   (function)
        STRSCI     (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        This could probably be written a little more efficiently.
        Also, plotting output has been kept very basic, as we are
        mostly using this for quick validation plots, which do not
        need to be fancy.

 EXAMPLE:
        PLOT_MASSCONS, 'tracer_mass_kg_2017.dat'

        ; Creates a plot from the data in the given file name.

             for both models (e.g. SFC_1, SFC_2, 500_1, 500_2).
             NOTE: This is in Fortran notation (starting from 1!)

        TAUS -> A 2-element vector contaning TAU values (hours GMT
             from /1/1985) corresponding to the "old" and "new"
             GEOS-Chem model versions.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DO_FULLCHEM -> Set this switch to plot the chemically
             produced OH in addition to the advected tracers.

        /DYNRANGE -> Set this switch to create plots using the whole
             dynamic range of the data.  Default is to restrict
             the plot range from 0.5 to 2.0.

        /PS -> Set this switch to generate PostScript output.

        OUTFILENAME -> If /PS is set, will write PostScript output

 NAME:
        READDATA

 PURPOSE:
        This subroutine reads in  almost any ASCII file and returns 
        two arrays containing the names of the variables and their 
        values.  The data is read line by line or in one step if 
        LINES is specified.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       READDATA, FILENAME, DATA, HEADER [, NCOL, NDAT ] [, KEYWORDS ]

 INPUTS:
       FNAME -> Name of fname to be read, e.g. 'flight12.dat'

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       COLS -> number of columns to be read (must be used if no header 
             is read in, i.e. /NOHEADER is specified). Can be used
             to read in a subset of columns if the file contains a header
             line with variable names (i.e. if *not* /NOHEADER).

       LINES -> number of lines to be read (not much faster for large
             data sets, but allows to read in a subset of the data)

       DELIM -> Separator between names in the header (default=',')

       SKP1 -> Number of lines to be skipped before the variable 
             definition (default=0)

       SKP2 -> .. after the variable definition (default=0)

       SKIP -> same as SKP1 (SKP1 will overwrite SKIP. SKIP may be
             not longer supported in future versions !)

       AUTOSKIP  -> for files that state the number of comment lines 
             in the first line. If keyword NOHEADER is not set, READDATA 
             expects a list of variable names as last comment line.
             AUTOSKIP overrides settings of SKP1 and SKP2.

       TRANSPOSE -> Normally, 1st array dimension is for variables, 
             2nd is for observations. /TRANSPOSE will reverse that 
             order (see note).

       NOHEADER -> don't read a header (COLS must be specified in 
             this case !)

       NODATA -> don't read data (stop after header). DATA parameter 
             must still be specified !

       COMMENTS -> returns string array of all the comment lines in 
             the data file for later use

       MAXCOMMENTS -> limits maximum number of comment lines to be 
             retrieved (default: 255)

       QUIET -> Normally, READDATA prints the number of variables 
             found and  number of data lines read.  Use this option 
             to suppress all output.

       /DOUBLE -> If set, will return data in double precision.
             (Default is to return data in single precision.)

       NAN_REPLACEMENT -> Allows you to provide a replacement value
             for the following types of missing data fields: NaN,
             nan, NA, na, Infinity, infinity, Missing, missing.

 OUTPUTS:
       DATA -> data array that was read in

       NAMES -> string array of names in header

       NCOL -> integer containing the number of columns

       NDAT -> long integer containing the number of observations

       COMMENTS  -> string array containing all header lines.  
             If AUTOSKIP is set, skp1, and skp2 will contain the 
             actual amount of lines to skip (e.g. for re-storing 
             header information in EXPLORE)

 SUBROUTINES:
      External Subroutines Required:
      ==============================
      OPEN_FILE
      STRBREAK (function)
      USAGE

 REQUIREMENTS:
      None

 NOTES:
      Default of the returned DATA array is: 1st index = variable, 
      2nd index = observation. Use the /TRANSPOSE option for reverse order

      If /NOHEADER is used, then COLS must specify the actual number of
      data columns in FNAME. Otherwise it can be used to read a subset of 
      the data from 0 to cols-1 columns.

      IDL Parameters are optional. Of course, you should not readdata without
      passing a DATA argument, but you can ignore the HEADER,NCOL, and NDAT 
      params.

 EXAMPLES:
      (1)
      READDATA,'mydata.dat',DATA,HEADER,DELIM=' ',SKIP=5

      ... will read in the ASCII file mydata.dat and store the data in DATA.
      The header information will be stored in HEADER. The header items are
      seperated by blank spaces, and the first 5 lines should be ignored.
      To pick a certain variable afterwards, type:
      VAR = DATA(WHERE HEADER EQ 'MYVAR'),*)

      (2)
      READDATA,'noheader.dat',DATA,DELIM=';',NCOLS=3

      ... will read a three column ASCII file with no header information.
      You can manually make up a header with 
      HEADER = ['VAR1','VAR2','VAR3'] 
      or you can pass the HEADER argument and receive ['X1','X2','X3'] as
      header.

      (3)
      READDATA,'mydata.dat',DATA,HEADER,DELIM=' ',SKP1=5,LINES=60,COLS=4, $
         COMMENTS=COMMENTS

      ... will read in 60 lines and 4 columns of the ASCII file mydata.dat 
      and return 6 comment lines in COMMENTS (5 + variable names)


 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
         mgs  03/12/1997: - last update : 05/22/97
         mgs 01 Aug 1997: - added template
         mgs 15 Sep 1997: - added LINES option and removed some twitch in the
                            handling of TRANSPOSE. Unfortunately,
                            LINES does not improve the speed as
                            desired, but you can restrict the reading to
                            a smaller subset of the data.
         mgs 26 Sep 1997: MAJOR REVIEW
                          - bug fixes in noheader option
                          - bug fixes in COLS and NCOL handling
                          - removed units option and created comments 
                            keyword instead.  program now reads in
                            all header lines into a string array
                            including the variable names line.
                          - automatic generation of a header if 
                            /NOHEADER is specified
         mgs 06 Nov 1997: - Added AUTOSKIP option for easier reading 
                            of e.g. NASA formatted files.
         mgs 01 Dec 1997: added MAXCOMMENTS keyword and limit
                          - skp1 now returns correct amount if
                            autoskip is set
         mgs 30 Dec 1997: added NODATA keyword
         mgs 21 Aug 1998: now uses open_file routine to allow wildcards
         bmy 12 May 2005: added /DOUBLE keyword to force double precision
  bmy & phs, 21 Aug 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Now use STRBREAK, which is version independent
                          - Remove internal function USE_READDATA; we
                            now call USAGE to display program options
                            if the wrong # of arguments are passed
                          - Updated comments
        bmy, 12 Dec 2012: GAMAP VERSION 2.16 
                          - Now give the user the option to read in
                            data as characters and then to strip out
                            strings such as "NaN" or "NA" via the
                          - NAN_REPLACEMENT keyword

        ; Will read a file that the user selects with the PICKFILE
        ; dialog. No information about the actual filename is
        ; returned.

        FILE = '~/tmp/*.bdt'
        READ_BDT0001,FILE,data,vardesc,nvars,nlines,file_id=file_id

        ; Does the same thing, but this time FILE will contain the
        ; actual filename. The number of variables and lines are
        ; returned in NVARS and NLINES, the file identifier string
        ; is returned in file_id

 NAME:
        READ_CONC_RANGE

 PURPOSE:
        Reads a file containing default plotting range for given 
        GEOS-Chem tracers.  This will be used to create absolute 
        difference plots for GEOS-Chem benchmarking.

 CATEGORY:
        Benchmarking

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_CONC_RANGE, INPUTFILE

 INPUTS:
        INPUTFILE -> Name of the file that contains the default
             plotting ranges for each GEOS-Chem tracer.  Default
             is "diff_range.1mon".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================
        OPEN_FILE   STRBREAK (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        READ_CONC_RANGE must be called first to read the file with
        default plotting ranges.  This is normally done at the top
        of driver routine BENCHMARK_1MON.  After this has been done,
        function GET_CONC_RANGE may be used to return the default
        plotting range from within another program.

 NOTES:
        (1) Meant to be used in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem 
            benchmark plotting codes.
 
        (2) Default ranges for each tracer are read from a file by 
            this routine and stored in the GDR common block.

 NAME:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE

 PURPOSE:
        Reads a file containing default plotting range for given 
        GEOS-Chem tracers.  This will be used to create absolute 
        difference plots for GEOS-Chem benchmarking.

 CATEGORY:
        Benchmarking

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE, INPUTFILE

 INPUTS:
        INPUTFILE -> Name of the file that contains the default
             plotting ranges for each GEOS-Chem tracer.  Default
             is "diff_range.1mon".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================
        OPEN_FILE   STRBREAK (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE must be called first to read the file with
        default plotting ranges.  This is normally done at the top
        of driver routine BENCHMARK_1MON.  After this has been done,
        function GET_DIFF_RANGE may be used to return the default
        plotting range from within another program.

 NOTES:
        (1) Meant to be used in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem 
            benchmark plotting codes.
 
        (2) Default ranges for each tracer are read from a file by 
            this routine and stored in the GDR common block.

 EXAMPLE:
        READ_DIFF_RANGE, 'diff_range.1mon'
        PRINT, GET_DIFF_RANGE( 'NOx' )
            -0.100000  0.100000
   
            ; Prints the default plotting range for NOx

 NAME:
        READ_SONDE

 PURPOSE:
        Read climatological ozone sonde data as compiled by 
        Jennifer A. Logan at Harvard University.
        If successful, the procedure returns a structure 
        with all information from a sondeXXX.* file.
        Ozone concentrations are automatically converted to ppbv.
        The data can be downloaded via ftp from io.harvard.edu
        path= pub/exchange/sonde. Please read the README files!

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences, File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_SONDE,filename,data

 INPUTS:
        filename -> Name of the file containing the sonde data.
            This parameter can contain wildcards (*,?) in which case
            a file selection dialog will be displayed. If filename
            is a variable, it will be replaced by the actual filename
            that was opened.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MBAR -> return ozone concentrations in mbar rather than ppbv

        STATIONS -> Can be used either as input or output for a list
            of station codes, locations and names as retrieved with
            procedure read_sondestations. STATIONS must be specified
            (or is returned) as an array of structures.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> A structure containing the following fields:
                TITLE           STRING    'Ozone sonde data'
                STATION         STRING    <station name>

        If the station.codes file was read successfully, three more tags
        are added to the structure:
                LAT, LON, ALT   FLOAT  < geographical location of station >

 SUBROUTINES:
        parse_line

 REQUIREMENTS:
        This subroutine uses the following procedures and functions that
        are not contained in the standard IDL distribution:
        READ_SONDESTATIONS : tool for reading the station.codes file
              (if you de-activate the line calling this procedure, READ_SONDE
               will still work but not return the station coordinates)

        EXTRACT_FILENAME  : a utility to seperate file path and file name 

        FILE_EXIST : a function testing for existance of a file

        OPEN_FILE  : more flexible than openr
              (if you choose not to use OPEN_FILE, you can replace the
               line that contains OPEN_FILE with:
                   OPENR,filename,ilun,/get_lun 
               You then don't need any of the following programs)

        UNDEFINE   : David Fanning's routine for dynamic removal of variables

 NOTES:

 EXAMPLE:
        ; read sonde data file
        read_sonde,filename,data

        ; test if successful
        if (n_elements(data) eq 0) then stop

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve station codes and geographical locations for 
        ozone sonding stations as listed in file station.codes
        from Jennifer A. Logan's ozone sonde climatology.
        This routine is called from procedure READ_SONDE, and
        only needs to be called explicitely if the station.codes
        file resides neither in the current directory nor the 
        directory of the sonde data files.
        The procedure will read the file station.codes once then
        store the information in a common block for later use.

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences, File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_SONDESTATIONS,stations [,filename]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME (optional) -> if given, it specifies the path and filename
              of the file that is normally called station.codes.
              FILENAME may contain wildcards (*,?) in which case a 
              file selector dialog is displayed. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        STATIONS -> An array with structures containing the stations
              codes (integer), latitude, longitude, altitude (float),
              amd name (string). 

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses OPEN_FILE and EXTRACT_FILENAME (used in OPEN_FILE)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        read_sondestations,stations,'station.codes'
        ; if called for the first time, reads file station.codes
        ; and returns information for all stations in stations.
        ; NOTE: In this case, the filename argument could have been
        ; omitted.

        GETMODELANDGRIDINFO      UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) It is best to regrid the aeorsol dust files 1 month
            at a time, since it can take quite a while to regrid
            all of the tracers and levels.  One can then use GAMAP
            to concatenate the monthly files.

        (2) Aerosol concentrations are used in the photolysis code
            since they also cause the incoming solar radiation
            to be scattered out of a column.

        (3) Assumes that the input file is already in binary punch
            format.  To regrid data directly from Paul Ginoux's
            GOCART model simulations, use "regridh_dust.raw.pro".

        REGRIDH_AEROSOL, INFILENAME='aerosol.geos3.2x25', $
                         OUTFILENAME='aerosol.geos3.4x5', $

             be written.  Default is 'merge_nobiofuels.geos.{resolution}'.  

        /COPY -> If set, will just copy the 1 x 1 data from the ASCII
             file to a binary punch file format, w/o regridding.

        (2) Also assumes 10 fossil fuel emission species -- 
            change this number as is necessary.

        (3) Now use CTM_REGRIDH, which is much quicker since it
            saves the mapping weights

 EXAMPLE:
        REGRIDH_ANTHRO, OUTMODELNAME='GEOS_STRAT', $
                        OUTRESOLUTION=4

        /SEASONAL -> Use this switch to process seasonal biomass
             burning files (instead of interannual variability
             files).

        YEAR -> 4-digit year number for which to regrid data 
             for interannual variability biomass burning.  YEAR
             is ignored if SEASONAL=0.  Default is 1996.

        (2) Now assumes 13 biomass burning tracers -- change this
            number as necessary.

        (3) REGRID_BIOBURN now will produce output for a whole
            year in one file.  This is most convenient.

        (4) Sometimes you might have to close all files and call
            "ctm_cleanup.pro" in between calls to this routine.

 EXAMPLE:
        REGRIDH_BIOBURN, OUTMODELNAME='GEOS_STRAT', OUTRESOLUTION=4, $

        OUTMODELNAME -> A string containing the name of the model 
             grid onto which the data will be regridded.  If
             OUTMODELNAME is not specified, REGRIDH_C3H8_C2H6 will 
             use the same model name as the input grid.

        OUTRESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             onto which the data will be regridded.  RESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        REGRIDH_DUST [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MONTH -> Month of year for which to process data.  Default is
             1 (January).  Since the dust files are very large, it may
             take several iterations to regrid an entire year of
             data.  You can break the job down 1 month at a time.

        INFILENAME -> Name of the file containing the dust data 
             which is to be regridded.  If INFILENAME is not specified,
             then REGRIDH_DUST will prompt the user to specify a file
             name via a dialog box.

        OUTMODELNAME -> A string containing the name of the model 
             grid onto which the data will be regridded.  If not
             specified, then OUTMODELNAME will be set to the same
             value as the grid stored in INFILENAME.

        OUTRESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             onto which the data will be regridded.  OUTRESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the directory where the output file will
             be written.  If not specified, then a dialog box
             will ask the user to supply a file name.

        DIAGN -> Diagnostic category of data block that you want
             to regrid.  Default is "MDUST-$".

        bmy, 22 Jan 2003: VERSION 1.01
        bmy, 15 Apr 2003: VERSION 1.02
                          - now reads bpch file w/o using CTM_GET_DATA;
                            this keeps us from running out of memory
        bmy, 22 Dec 2003: VERSION 1.03
                          - rewritten for GAMAP v2-01
                          - rewritten so that we can now regrid files
                            containing less than GRIDINFO.LMX levels
                          - reorganized a few things for clarity
        bmy, 13 Apr 2004: VERSION 1.04
                          - now use surface pressure files on both
                            the input and output grids
                          - now use separate arrays for airmass
                            on the two grids
                          - now adjusts polar latitudes so as to avoid
                            artificial buildup of concentration when
                            regridding from coarse --> fine grids
        bmy, 31 Jan 2005: VERSION 1.05
                          - Minor bug fix: INAREA and OUTAREA should
                            have units of [m2] for the airmass computation
                          - Now use /QUIET and /NOPRINT keywords in
                            call to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK
        bmy, 26 May 2005: VERSION 1.06
                          - added /GCAP keyword for special handling
                            when creating restart files on 4x5 GCAP grid
                          - now references INTERPOLATE_2D function
  bmy & phs, 20 Jun 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - fixed typo for fine -> coarse regridding
                          - Now use FILE_WHICH to locate surf prs files
        bmy, 22 Nov 2010: GAMAP VERSION 2.15
                          - Remove pointer stuff to avoid errors.
                            Now just use the assignment

 NAME:
        REGRIDH_RESTART_NC

 PURPOSE:
        Horizontally regrids data in [v/v] mixing ratio from one
        model grid to another.  Data is converted to [kg] for 
        regridding, and then converted back to [v/v].       

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        REGRIDH_RESTART [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        INFILENAME -> Name of the file containing data to be regridded.
             If INFILENAME is not specified, then REGRIDH_RESTART
             will prompt the user to select a file via a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file which will contain the regridded 
             data.  If OUTFILENAME is not specified, then REGRIDH_RESTART
             will prompt the user to select a file via a dialog box.

        OUTMODELNAME -> Name of the model grid onto which the data
             will be regridded.  If OUTMODELNAME is not specified, 
             then REGRIDH_RESTART will use the same model name as the
             input grid.

        OUTRESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             onto which the data will be regridded.  OUTRESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

        DIAGN -> Diagnostic category of the data blocks that you 
            wish to regrid.  Default is "IJ-AVG-$".

        /GCAP -> Set this switch to regrid a 4x5 GEOS-3 or GEOS-4 
            restart file to a "fake" GEOS grid containing 45 latitudes
            but the same # of levels.  You can then regrid the file
            vertically using regridv_restart.pro.

 NOTES:
        (1) 2-D Stratospheric J-Values are needed for the simple chemistry 
            mechanism in the stratosphere.  They are originally obtained 
            by running the GEOS model with SLOW-J and then archiving 
            the J-Values with the ND22 diagnostic.  These can then be
            regridded to other vertical resolutions via REGRIDV_STRATJV.

 EXAMPLE:
        REGRIDV_STRATJV, INFILENAME='stratjv.geos3.4x5'
                         OUTFILENAME='stratjv.geos3.2x25'

 NOTES:
        2-D Stratospheric J-Values are needed for the simple chemistry 
        mechanism in the stratosphere.  They are originally obtained 
        by running the GEOS model with SLOW-J and then archiving 
        the J-Values with the ND22 diagnostic.  These can then be
        regridded to other vertical resolutions via REGRID_STRATJV.

 EXAMPLE:
        REGRIDVH_STRATJV, INFILENAME='stratjv.geoss.4x5'
                          OUTMODELNAME='GEOS3',      $

 NAME:
        REGRIDV_DUST

 PURPOSE:
        Vertically regrids mineral dust concentrations [kg/m3]
        from one CTM grid to another.  Total mass is conserved.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        REGRIDV_DUST [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MONTH -> Month of year for which to process data.  Default is
             the entire year.  Since the dust files are very large,
             it take several iterations to regrid an entire year of
             data.  You can break the job down 1 month at a time.

        INFILENAME -> Name of the file containing data to be regridded.
             If omitted, then REGRIDV_DUST will prompt the user to
             select a filename with a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of output file containing the regridded
             data.  If OUTFILENAME is not specified, then REGRIDV_DUST
             will ask the user to specify a file via a dialog box.

        OUTMODELNAME -> Name of the model grid onto which the data
             will be regridded.  If OUTMODELNAME is not specified, 
             REGRIDV_DUST will use the same model name as the
             input grid.

        DIAGN -> Diagnostic category of data block that you want
             to regrid.  Default is "MDUST-$".

        /TROP_ONLY -> If set, will only regrid data within the
             tropopause (i.e. up to the level specified by
             MODELINFO.NTROP).

 NAME:
        REGRID_BIOFUEL

 PURPOSE:
        Regrids 1 x 1 biomass burning emissions for NOx or CO
        onto a CTM grid of equal or coarser resolution.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MODELNAME -> A string containing the name of the model 
             grid onto which the data will be regridded.

        RESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             onto which the data will be regridded.  RESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

 NAME:
        REGRID_COLUMN

 PURPOSE:
        Vertically regrids a column quantity in such a way
        as to preserve the total mass.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DATA2 = REGRID_COLUMN( DATA1, PEDGE1, PEDGE2 [, keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA1 -> Column vector containing data on the original
             grid.  DATA1 must be a mass-like quantity that does
             not have any vertical dependence (e.g. molecules,
             g, kg, kg/m2, molec/cm2, etc.) 

        PEDGE1 -> Pressures [hPa] at the edges of each layer on 
             the old vertical grid.  PEDGE1 will thus have one 
             more element element than DATA1 (since DATA1 is 
             specified on the midpoints of each layer).

        PEDGE2 -> Pressures [hPa] at the edges of each layer on 
             the new vertical grid.  PEDGE2 will thus have one 
             more element element than DATA2 (since DATA2 is 
             specified on the midpoints of each layer).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /DEBUG -> If set, will print debug information to the
             screen, including totals before and after regridding.

        /NO_CHECK -> If this keyword is set, then REGRID_COLUMN
             will not check to see if the column sum was preserved
             in going from the old grid to the new grid.  This is 
             useful if you are regridding data from a grid with a
             high model top to a grid with a lower model top 
             (such as from GEOS-3 to GEOS-1).

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA2 -> Column vector containing data on the new vertical 
             grid.  The column sum of DATA2 will equal that of
             DATA1. DATA2 will also be a mass-like quantity.


 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Adapted from FORTRAN code by Amanda Staudt, Bob
        Yantosca, and Dale Allen originally used to interpolate
        GEOS-3 data from Pressure to Sigma coordinates.

        (2) The algorithm is brute force, but it works for all 
        kinds of grids.  It will even work for grids where the new
        vertical resolution is smaller than the original vertical
        resolution.

        (3) Processes one column at a time.  For an entire lat/lon
        region, you have to loop over each surface grid location
        and call REGRID_COLUMN to process each column separately.

        (4) Added /NO_CHECK keyword to facilitate regridding from
        GEOS-3 to GEOS-1.  Otherwise, you should never use this
        keyword.

 EXAMPLE:
 
        ; Surface pressure (assume same for both grids)
        PSurf = 1000.0

        ; Define Input grid -- use GAMAP routines
        InType   = CTM_Type( 'GEOS_STRAT', res=2 )
        InGrid   = CTM_Grid( InType )
        InPEdge  = ( InGrid.SigEdge * ( PSurf - InType.PTOP ) ) + $
                   Intype.PTOP
        
        ; Define Output grid -- use GAMAP routines
        OutType  = CTM_Type( 'GEOS3', res=2, PSurf=1000.0 )
        OutGrid  = CTM_Grid( OutType )
        OutPEdge = ( OutGrid.SigEdge * ( PSurf - OutType.PTOP ) ) +
                    OutType.PTOP

        ; Assume INDATA is in [kg], OUTDATA will be too
        OutData = Regrid_Column( InData, InPEdge, OutPEdge )

             ; Regrid a column of mass from the 2 x 2.5
             ; GEOS-STRAT grid to the 2 x 2.5 GEOS-3 grid

 NAME:
        REGRID_DUST

 PURPOSE:
        Regrids 2.5 x 2.5 mineral dust concentrations 
        onto a CTM grid of equal or coarser resolution.

 CATEGORY:
        Regridding

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        REGRID_DUST [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MONTH -> Month of year for which to process data.
             Default is 1 (January).

        MODELNAME -> A string containing the name of the model 
             grid onto which the data will be regridded.

        RESOLUTION -> Specifies the resolution of the model grid
             onto which the data will be regridded.  RESOLUTION
             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

        OUTDIR -> Name of the directory where the output file will
             be written.  Default is './'.  

 OUTPUTS:
        Writes binary punch file:
             dust.{MODELNAME}.{RESOLUTION}

 SUBROUTINES:

        CTM_NAMEXT    (function)   CTM_RESEXT (function)
        CTM_WRITEBPCH  

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) The path names for the files containing dust data are
            hardwired -- change as necessary!

        (2) Even though photolysis rates are only needed in the 
            troposphere, we need to save the mineral dust for all
            levels of the model.  Scattering by mineral dust is
            used to compute the actinic flux, and therefore we need
            to account for this all the way to the atmosphere top.

        (3) The regridding process can take a very long time to
            complete.  If you are regridding, it is recommended to
            process one month at a time, and then to concatenate
            the binary punch files using GAMAP.

 EXAMPLE:
        REGRID_DUST, MODELNAME='GEOS_STRAT', RESOLUTION=4
           
             ; Regrids dust data from 2 x 2.5 native resolution

 NAME:
        REPLACE_TOKEN (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Replaces occurrences of tokens with text. Can also
        be used to expand wildcards with a name list.

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = REPLACE_TOKEN( STR, TOKEN, TEXT, [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        STR -> The string to be searched for tokens. This must be
             a scalar string.
 
        TOKEN -> A string or string array containing the token text
             *OR* a structure. If TOKEN is a structure, the tag
             names will be used as Tokens and the tag values will
             be converted to string and used as TEXT.  TOKEN is 
             case-insensitive and will always be used as uppercase.

        TEXT -> A string or string array containing the replacement 
             text. TEXT may be some other type than string on input. 
             In this case it will be returned as string and formatted 
             according to the optional FORMAT keyword.  If TOKEN is 
             provided as a structure, TEXT will return the (formatted)
             tag values as strings.  TOKEN and TEXT must have the same 
             number of elements with one exception: If TOKEN contains 
             only one element while TEXT is an array, the result will 
             be a string array where each string has TOKEN replaced 
             with the corresponding TEXT value (wildcard replacement). 
             [see example 7]

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DELIMITER  -> The delimiter character for TOKEN.  Default is 
             '%'.  The delimiter will be automatically appended to the
             beginning and end of TOKEN if not already there.

        COUNT -> Number of tokens that were replaced. If TOKEN has 
             more than one element or tag, COUNT will be an integer 
             array.

        VERBOSE -> Will print a warning message if no tokens are found.

        FORMAT -> A string or string array containing format 
            specifications for each element of TEXT or each tag of 
            the TOKEN structure. If FORMAT contains only one element, 
            this will be used throughout. For wildcard replacement, 
            the default format is I14 (number will be trimmed).

        TFORMAT -> (type format) If TOKEN is provided as a structure, 
            it may contain data of various types. You can use TFORMAT 
            to specify a format code for each data type (see IDL SIZE
            function) instead of each tag number as with the FORMAT 
            keyword. TFORMAT should contain at least 6 elements to 
            allow formatting of double precision data, or 8 elements 
            if you want to output complex data.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> String with replaced text.  If TOKEN is a single 
            string and TEXT is an array, then the result is an array 
            with N(text) elements.  In case of errors, an empty string
             is returned.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Used:
        ========================================
        CHKSTRU (function)   STRRIGHT (function)
 
 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) The original input string (STR) is not altered.

        (2) REPLACE_TOKEN will search for and replace multiple
            occurrences of the same token in the input string (STR).

        (3) Use DELIM='' for wildcard replacement.

        (4) If no tokens are found in the input string, then
            REPLACE_TOKEN returns the original input string (STR)
            as the value of the function.  

        (5) The use of structures for TOKEN allows for different
            data types.

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        STR     = 'Hello, My Name is %NAME% and %NAME%.'
        NEWSTR  = REPLACE_TOKEN( Str, 'NAME', 'Robert' )
        PRINT, NEWSTR
           Hello, my name is Robert and Robert.

             ; Replace multiple tokens in the input string

        (2) 
        STR   = 'His name is %NAME% and he lives in %STREET%, %CITY%'
        TOKEN = { NAME   : 'Henry', $
                  STREET : '29 Oxford St.', $
                  CITY   : 'Cambridge, MA',   $
                  ZIP    : '02138' }
        PRINT, REPLACE_TOKEN( STR, TOKEN )
           His name is Henry and he lives in 
           29 Oxford St., Cambridge, MA
           
           ; Use a structure to replace several items at once
           ; (Note: ZIP code is not used!)

        (3) 
        STR = 'His name is NAME and he lives in STREET, CITY'
        PRINT, REPLACE_TOKEN( STR, TOKEN, DELIM='' )
           His Henry is Henry and he lives in ...

             ; Use of an empty delimiter (same TOKEN as above)
             ; (Exercise: what went wrong ?)

        (4) 
        STR = 'The date is 2003/01/01.'
        PRINT, REPLACE_TOKEN( STR, '2003', 2005', DELIM='' )
           The date is 2005/01/01.

 NAME:
	RESOLVE_EVERY


 PURPOSE:
	Resolve (by compiling) all procedures and functions.
	This is useful when preparing .sav files containing all the IDL
	routines required for an application.

 CATEGORY:
       General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	RESOLVE_EVERY

 INPUTS:
	None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	QUIET = if set, produce no messages.
 	SKIP_ROUTINES = an optional string array containing the names
 	    of routines to NOT resolve.  This is useful when a library
 	    file containing the designated routines will be later included.

 OUTPUTS:
	No explicit outputs.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None

 RESTRICTIONS:
	Will not resolve procedures or functions that are called via
	CALL_PROCEDURE, CALL_FUNCTION, or EXECUTE.  Only explicit calls
	are resolved.

	If an unresolved procedure or function is not in the IDL 
	search path, an error occurs, and no additional routines
	are resolved.

 PROCEDURE:
	This routine iteratively determines the names of unresolved calls
	to user-written or library procedures and functions, and then
	compiles them.  The process stops when there are no unresolved
	routines.

 EXAMPLE:
	RESOLVE_EVERY.

        =================================================
        ADD_SEPARATOR (function)   MFINDFILE
        STRDATE       (function)   STRRIGHT  (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        The program files must have a standard header with tag
        "MODIFICATION HISTORY" as last item. This must be followed
        with a ;- line (!! NOT ;----- !!).

        The REVISIONS file will be written in the directory DIRNAME,
        thus the user must have write permission.

 NOTES:
        (1) All *.pro file in the given directory will be analyzed.
        (2) Also see IDL routine ADD_TEMPLATE

 EXAMPLE:
        REVISIONS, '~/IDL/gamap2/doc/'

             ; Will produce a REVISIONS file for all of the
             ; *.pro files w/in the '~/IDL/gamap2/doc' directory

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 16 Jun 1998: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 25 May 1999: - added caution for tag detection in this

 NAME:
	 REWRITE_AGPROD


 PURPOSE:
        To rewrite a APROD / GPROD restart file with a different
        timestamp TAU0. The correspondence b/w file name and timestamp
        is enforced, as required by GEOS-Chem.

 CATEGORY:
	 Date & Time


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	 REWRITE_AGPROD, INFILE='old_file_name', TAU0=tau | YMD=yyyymmdd

 INPUTS:
	 None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        INFILENAME -> initial restart_aprod_gprod file. If not
             passed, a dialog window will pop up.

        TAU0 (double) -> the new time stamp you want, in Tau units

        YMD (long) -> the new time stamp you want, in YYMMDD or YYYYMMDD

        HH -> hour for this date (e.g. 6 for 6 a.m.)  Default is 0.

        Either TAU0 or YMD should be passed. If both are passed,
        TAU0 is used.

 OUTPUTS:
 	 None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	 A file named restart_aprod_gprod.YYYYMMDDHH where YYYYMMDDHH
        corresponds with TAU0 in the data blocks is created.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	 The input file must be a restart_aprod_gprod file.

 NOTES:
        This is not a regridding routine. To regrid a
        restart_aprod_gprod file, use :

           REGRIDV_RESTART, ..., DIAGN=0

        or/and

           REGRIDH_RESTART, ..., DIAGN=0

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> returns the file in which the routine can be found

        /CALLER -> returns information about the caller of the routine
           instead of the routine itself

 OUTPUTS:

        characters (can be used to construct a filename by adding
        ".pro")

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        From the command line:
             PRINT, ROUTINE_NAME()
        results in   $main$

        Very useful in conjunction with USAGE.PRO:
             USAGE, ROUTINE_NAME()
        displays help information on the current routine.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 27 Mar 1998: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 22 Apr 1998: - added FILENAME and CALLER keywords

 NAME:
        RUN_AV (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Compute running average or running total of a
        data vector. Compared to the IDL function TS_SMOOTH,
        this function takes into account missing values or
        gaps in an optional x vector, and it allows for 
        even bandwidths. It can also be used to compute cumulative
        totals.

 CATEGORY:
        Math & Units

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        result = RUN_AV(Y [,X] [,keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        Y -> the data vector (a 2-D array will be treated as a vector)

        X -> an optional X vector defining e.g. the sample times.
             This only has an effect when the DELTAX keyword is specified.
             X must be monotonically increasing and have the same 
             number of elements as Y.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        WIDTH -> The number of points to use for the average or total
             Default is 1, i.e. Y is returned unchanged.

        MINWIDTH -> The minimum number of points that must be valid 
             in order to return a average or total for the given point.
             Default is MINWIDTH=WIDTH, i.e. all points must be valid
             (and if X and DELTAX are specified, all points must lie
             within WIDTH*DELTAX). 

        MIN_VALID -> The minimum value for valid data. Data with less than
             MIN_VALID will be considered missing. MIN_VALID is also used
             to indicate invalid totals or averages (1% is subtracted).

        DELTAX -> The maximum gap between two consecutive x values.
             Only effective when X is given.

        COUNT -> A named variable will return the number of points used 
             in each average or total.

        /TOTAL -> Set this keyword to compute running totals instead 
             of running averages.

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns a vector with running averages or totals.
        The number of elements in the result vector always equals the 
        number of elements in Y (unless an error occurs). 

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NOTES:
        This function can also be used to compute accumulative totals.
        Simply set WIDTH to n_elements(Y) and MINWIDTH to 1 and use
        the /TOTAL keyword. However, this is very uneffective for large 
        data vectors!

 EXAMPLE:
        y = findgen(20)
        print,run_av(y,width=4)
        ; IDL prints: -1E31 -1E31 -1E31  1.5  2.5  3.5  4.5 ...

        print,run_av(y,width=4,/TOTAL)
        ; IDL prints: -1E31 -1E31 -1E31  6  10  14  18 ...

        ; (cumulative total)
        print,run_av(y,width=n_elements(y),minwidth=1,/TOTAL)
        ; IDL prints:  0  1  3  ...  190

        x = [ 0, 2, 4, 6, 16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33 ]
        y = fltarr(n_elements(x)) + 1.
        print,run_av(y,x,width=4,count=c)
        ; IDL prints: -1E31  -1E31  -1E31  1  1  1  1  ...

        ; IDL prints:  1  2  3  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4  4

        print,run_av(y,x,deltax=2,width=4,count=c)
        ; IDL prints: -1E31  -1E31  -1E31  1  -1E31  -1E31  -1E31

 NAME:
        SCREEN2GIF

 PURPOSE:
        Captures an image from the X-window or Z-buffer device and 
        saves the image to a GIF file.  Handles 8-bit and TRUE
        COLOR displays correctly.
  
 CATEGORY:
        Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        SCREEN2GIF, FILENAME [ , Keywords ]

        FILENAME -> Name of the GIF file that will be created.
             FILENAME may be omitted if you wish to only return
             the image (via the THISFRAME keyword).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        THISFRAME -> Returns to the calling program the 
             byte image captured from the screen.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================
        TVREAD (function)   

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        (1) Should work for Unix/Linux, Macintosh, and Windows.
   
        (2) SCREEN2GIF is now a wrapper for TVREAD.  David Fanning's 
            TVREAD function does the screen capture better than 
            the algorithm in the old SCREEN2GIF.

 EXAMPLES:
        PLOT, X, Y
        SCREEN2GIF, 'myplot.gif'

             ; Creates a simple plot and writes it to a GIF file
             ; via capture from the screen (X-window device).

        PLOT, X, Y

             ; Creates a simple plot and saves the screen 
             ; capture image to the byte array THISFRAME. 

        OPEN_DEVICE, /Z
        PLOT, X, Y
        SCREEN2GIF, 'myplot.gif'

 INPUTS:
        DATE -> (OPTIONAL) Either a up to 6 element array containing 
            year, month, day, hour, minute, and secs (i.e. the format 
            returned from BIN_DATE) or a structure containing year, 
            month, day, hour, minute, seconds (as returned from 
            TAU2YYMMDD) or a date string in "standard" format as 
            returned by SYSTIME(0).  If DATE is omitted, STRDATE will 
            automatically return the current system time. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /SHORT -> omit the time value, return only date

        /SORTABLE -> will return 'YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM' 

        /EUROPEAN -> will return 'DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM'

 NAME:
        STRPAD

 PURPOSE:
        This function returns the source string padded with leading
        and/or trailing white-space characters.

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

        Result = STRPAD( Source, Length [, Pos] )

 INPUTS:
        Source:   A string or number you want padded with white-space
                  characters.

        Length:   The total length of the returned padded string.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

        Pos:      Position of the Source string within the returned
                  padded string. [0=Default]

 OUTPUTS:
        The source parameter is returned as a string with leading
        and/or trailing white-space characters.

 RESTRICTIONS:
        The Length and Pos parameters must be in the range [0-255].

 EXAMPLE:
        Let's say you want 'bob' to have a length of 10 characters
        with spaces padded after 'bob':

        bob10 = STRPAD( 'bob', 10 )

        Or if you want 'bob' to be at the end:

        bobend= STRPAD( 'bob', 10, 7 )

 NAME:
        STRREPL (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Replace all occurences of one character in a string with 
        another character. The character to be replaced can either 
        be given as string of length 1 or as an index array
        containing the character positions (see strwhere).  This 
        function also works for string arrays.

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = STRREPL( STR, FROMCHAR, TOCHAR [,/IGNORECASE] )

 INPUTS:
        STR -> the string to be changed

        FROMCHAR -> either: a string of length 1 (the character 
             to be replaced) or: an index array with the character 
             positions

        TOCHAR -> replacement character

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        IGNORECASE -> if set, fromchar will be treated 
             case-insensitive (only if fromchar is a character)

        FOLD_CASE -> same thing but following IDL naming 
             (e.g. StrMatch)

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> A string of same length as the input string
             with the text replaced

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NOTES:
        Uses SIZE(/TYPE) available since IDL 5.2

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        UFILE = '/usr/local/idl/lib/test.pro'
        WFILE = 'c:' + strrepl(ufile,'/','\')
        PRINT, WFILE
        ;  c:\usr\local\idl\lib\test.pro

             ; Convert a Unix filename to Windows

        (2)
        A      = 'abcdabcdabcd'
        INDEX  = [ strwhere(a,'a'), strwhere(a,'b') ] > 0
        PRINT, STRREPL( a, index, '#' )
           ##cd##cd##cd

             ; Use with index (uses strwhere function)

 NAME:
        STRSCI (function)

 PURPOSE:                                                 
        Given a number, returns a string of that number in 
        scientific notation format ( e.g. A x 10  )

 CATEGORY:
        Strings

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = STRSCI( DATA  [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> A floating point or integer number to be
             converted into a power of 10.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FORMAT -> The format specification used in the string
             conversion for the mantissa (i.e. the "A" of 
             "A x 10^B").  Default is '(f12.2)'.  

        /POT_ONLY -> Will return only the "power of 10" part of 
             the string (i.e. the "10^B").  Default is to return 
             the entire string (e.g. "A x 10^B" )

        /MANTISSA_ONLY -> return only mantissa of the string

        /SHORT -> return 10^0 as '1' and 10^1 as '10'

        /TRIM -> don't insert blanks (i.e. return Ax10^B)

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        This function does not "evaluate" the format statement thoroughly
        which can result in somewhat quirky strings. Example:
        print,strsci(-9.999) results in -10.0x10^0 instead of -1.0x10^1.

        Need a better symbol than the 'x' for the multiplier...

 EXAMPLE:
        Result = STRSCI( 2000000, format='(i1)' )
        print, result                
        ;                                                     6
        ;     prints 2 x 10!u6!n, which gets plotted as 2 x 10 
        
        Result = STRSCI( -0.0001 )
        print, result
        ;                                                            4
        ;     prints -1.00 x 10!u-4!n, which gets plotted as 1.00 x 10

        Result = STRSCI( 0d0, format='(f13.8)' )
        print, result
        ;
        ;     prints, 0.00000000

 NAME:
        STRUADDVAR (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Add additional variables (tags) to an exisiting
        structure. The new variables will be inserted after
        the old ones, '__' tags will be appended at the end.
        The function renames new tags if they would cause 
        duplicate names by adding a '_A'.

 CATEGORY:
        Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NEWSTRU = STRUADDVAR( OLDSTRU, NEWVAR [, NEWNAME, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        OLDSTRU -> the exisiting structure. This must be a structure, 
             otherwise the program will complain and exit.

        NEWVAR -> A new variable (any type) or a new structure
             that shall be incorporated into OLDSTRU. If NEWVAR
             is *not* a structure, then NEWNAME must be present.
             If you want to add an array with several named columns,
             use Arr2Stru first.

        NEWNAME -> The name of the new variable. Only used if 
             NEWVAR is no structure.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /WARNNELEMENTS -> If this flag is set,  the program will print out 
             a warning if the number of elements in the new variable does 
             not match the number of elements in the last variable of the 
             old structure.

 OUTPUTS:
        NEWSTRU -> A structure that combines the information from 
             OLDSTRU and NEWVAR.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================
        CHKSTRU (function)
 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) NEWNAME (or the tag names from NEWVAR) will be added to 
            the __NAMES__ tag if present. __EXTRA__ entries will be 
            combined only if tags within __EXTRA__ structures are 
            different.  If __EXTRA__ contains a non-structure
            variable it will be converted to a structure with tag 
            name 'EXTRA_N' where N is a number from 1-9, A-Z (the 
            first tag is just 'EXTRA').

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        NSTRU = STRUADDVAR( STRU, FINDGEN(100), 'DUMMY' )

             ; Adds a 100 element floating-point array
             ; to structure STRU under the tag name "DUMMY"
             ; and returns the result as NSTRU.

        (2) 

        X     = { A :0L,             B:STRARR(10),     $
                  C : FINDGEN(100),  __EXTRA__:'TEST' }
        OSTRU = STRUADDVAR( NSTRU, X )

             ; Adds the structure X (with tag names A, B, C, and
             ; __EXTRA__) to the structure NSTRU and returns
             ; the result as OSTRU.

             __NAMES__ tag
        
        EXTRA -> return information stored in __EXTRA__ tag. This
             information is always returned as a structure 

        NVARS -> return number of variables, i.e. tags that do 
             not begin with '__'

        HOMOGENEOUS -> return tag indices of tags with identical '
             number of elements (only those can be combined to an 
             array with Stru2Arr).  This keyword honors the RefIndex 
             keyword.

        NUMERIC -> return tag indices of numeric structure tags

        TYPE -> return variable type of structure tags. For 
             non-variable tags (whose name begin with '__') a -1 
             is returned
        
        REFINDEX -> indicates the tag index to compare the number 
             of elements to (default is the first variable index).

 NAME:
  STR_SIZE

 PURPOSE:

  The purpose of this function is to return the proper
  character size to make a specified string a specifed
  width in a window. The width is specified in normalized
  coordinates. The function is extremely useful for sizing
  strings and labels in resizeable graphics windows.

 CATEGORY:
  Strings, Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

  thisCharSize = STR_SIZE(thisSting, targetWidth)

 INPUTS:

  thisString:  This is the string that you want to make a specifed
     target size or width.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

  targetWidth:  This is the target width of the string in normalized
     coordinates in the current graphics window. The character
     size of the string (returned as thisCharSize) will be
     calculated to get the string width as close as possible to
     the target width. The default is 0.25.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

  INITSIZE:  This is the initial size of the string. Default is 1.0.

  STEP:   This is the amount the string size will change in each step
     of the interative process of calculating the string size.
     The default value is 0.05.

 OUTPUTS:

  thisCharSize:  This is the size the specified string should be set
     to if you want to produce output of the specified target
     width. The value is in standard character size units where
     1.0 is the standard character size.

 EXAMPLE:

  To make the string "Happy Holidays" take up 30% of the width of
  the current graphics window, type this:

               XYOUTS, 0.5, 0.5, ALIGN=0.5, "Happy Holidays", $
        CHARSIZE=STR_SIZE("Happy Holidays", 0.3)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  Written by: David Fanning, 17 DEC 96.
  Added a scaling factor to take into account the aspect ratio
     of the window in determing the character size. 28 Oct 97. DWF

 NAME:
        SYM

 PURPOSE:
        Define a standard sequence of plotting symbols that can
        be used in conjunction with the PLOT command.

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = SYM( NUMBER)           or also
        PLOT, X, Y, PSYM=SYM( NUMBER )

 INPUTS:
        NUMBER    ->   symbol number
 
               0 : dot
               1 : filled circle

              18 : greater-than symbol ">"
              19 : less-than symbol "<"

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Function returns the symbol number to be 
             used with PSYM= in the PLOT command.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        This function produces a side effect in that the USERSYM procedure
        is used to create a symbol definition. It's meant for usage within
        the PLOT, OPLOT, etc. command

 EXAMPLE:
        PLOT, X, Y, PSYM=SYM(0), SYMSIZE=3
             ; Produces a plot with dots (standard symbol 3)

        FOR I = 0, 17 DO OPLOT, X+1, Y, PSYM=SYM(I), COLOR=I
             ; overplots 17 curves each with its own symbol

 NAME:
        TAU2YYMMDD (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Converts a tau value (elapsed hours between
        the current date/time and the beginning of an epoch) into a
        calendar date and time value.

 CATEGORY:
        Date & Time

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = TAU2YYMMDD( TAU, [ NYMD0, NHMS0 ] )

 INPUTS:
        TAU -> the tau value to be converted (type long)

        NYMD0 (long) -> YY/MM/DD for the start of the epoch
                  default is {19}850101 which is the GEOS-1 start

        NHMS0 (long) -> HH/MM/SS for the start of the epoch
                  will be defaulted to 000000
        
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /NFORMAT --> produce 2-element vector instead of structure
              The result will be NYMD and NHMS with NYMD as YYYYMMDD.

        /SHORT --> produce 2-element vector with 2-digit year format.
              (implies NFORMAT=1)

        /GEOS1 -> use 1985/01/01 as epoch start

        /GISS_II -> use 1980/01/01 as epoch start

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> The function returns the calendar date and time as 
             either a structure with tags YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, 
             MINUTE, SECOND or a 2 element array with NYMD and NHMS 
             long values.

 SUBROUTINES:
        NYMD2STRU -> extracts year, month, day, hour, minute 
             and seconds from NYMD and NHMS values.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        Function NYMD2STRU is also embedded in NYMD2TAU function. This should
        be kept in mind when changes are necessary.

        Function STRDATE can be used to produce a formatted string from
        the structure returned by TAU2YYMMDD.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; get calendar structure from tau value for 1994/01/01 (GEOS)

           print,tau2yymmdd(78888,/GEOS1)

        result (structure with Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second):
        {    1994     1      1      0      0      0}

        ... and in the format of NYMD, NHMS

           print,tau2yymmdd(78888,/GEOS1,/NFORMAT)
           print,tau2yymmdd(78888,/GEOS1,/NFORMAT,/SHORT)

        results (array with 2 elements):
              19940101           0
                940101           0

 PURPOSE:
        Prints out the name, time, and min/max of data of GMAO or
        GISS/GCAP met data files which are used as input to GEOS-Chem.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TEST_MET, MODELINFO [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        MODELINFO -> Structure from CTM_TYPE which defines the model
             name, resolution, and other parameters.  NOTE: If the 
             met field files contain an IDENT string then TEST_MET
             will ignore the MODELINFO structure passed and instead
             will parse the IDENT string to obtain the model name
             and resolution.  (NOTE: GEOS-4, GEOS-5, and GCAP met
             fields contain an identification string which is read in
             to determine the proper model name.  For these met fields
             you won't need to supply MODELINFO.)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the binary met field file to examine.  If 
             FILENAME is not passed, then the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box query.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, then will echo extra information
             to the screen.

        XINDEX -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum longitude indices (in FORTRAN notation) which 
             define the nested model grid.

        YINDEX -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum longitude indices (in FORTRAN notation) which 
             define the nested model grid.

        XRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center longitudes which define the nested
             model grid. Default is [-180,180].

        YRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center latitudes which define the nested
             model grid. Default is [-90,90].

        PLOTLEVEL -> If specified, then TEST_MET will plot a lon-lat
             map of the given vertical level of the data.  Useful for
             debugging purposes.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for OPEN_FILE.

 NAME:
        TSDIAG

 PURPOSE:
        Reads and plots CTM time series (station) data. The
        data are returned in a structure together with longitude,
        latitude, altitude, and time information. TSDIAG tries to
        construct a time vector from the TAU information stored
        in the file. This may not always work (e.. it is assumed 
        that time steps are 1 hour).
           While reading, TSDIAG displays a '.' for each new station
        encountered, and a '+' if a station is continued. If you want 
        more detailed output, set the /VERBOSE flag.

 NAME:
     TVIMAGE

 PURPOSE:
     This purpose of TVIMAGE is to enable the TV command in IDL
     to be a completely device-independent and color-decomposition-
     state independent command. On 24-bit displays color decomposition
     is always turned off for 8-bit images and on for 24-bit images.
     The color decomposition state is restored for those versions of
     IDL that support it (> 5.2). Moreover, TVIMAGE adds features
     that TV lacks. For example, images can be positioned in windows
     using the POSITION keyword like other IDL graphics commands.
     TVIMAGE also supports the !P.MULTI system variable, unlike the
     TV command. TVIMAGE was written to work especially well in
     resizeable graphics windows. Note that if you wish to preserve
     the aspect ratio of images in resizeable windows, you should set
     the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword, described below. TVIMAGE works
     equally well on the display, in the PostScript device, and in
     the Printer and Z-Graphics Buffer devices. The TRUE keyword is
     set automatically to the correct value for 24-bit images, so you
     don't need to specify it when using TVIMAGE.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

     TVIMAGE, image

 INPUTS:
     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. It should be byte data.

       x  :    The X position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.
               If the Y position is not used, X is taken to be the image
               "position" in the window. See the TV command documenation
               for details.

       y  :    The Y position of the lower-left corner of the image.
               This parameter is only recognized if the TV keyword is set.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

     BACKGROUND:   This keyword specifies the background color. Note that
               the keyword ONLY has effect if the ERASE keyword is also
               set or !P.MULTI is set to multiple plots and TVIMAGE is
               used to place the *first* plot.

     ERASE:    If this keyword is set an ERASE command is issued
               before the image is displayed. Note that the ERASE
               command puts the image on a new page in PostScript
               output.

     _EXTRA:   This keyword picks up any TV keywords you wish to use.

     HALF_HALF: If set, will tell CONGRID to extrapolate a *half* row
               and column on either side, rather than the default of
               one full row/column at the ends of the array.  If you
               are interpolating images with few rows, then the
               output will be more consistent with this technique.
               This keyword is intended as a replacement for
               MINUS_ONE, and both keywords probably should not be
               used in the same call to CONGRID.

     KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO: Normally, the image will be resized to fit the
               specified position in the window. If you prefer, you can
               force the image to maintain its aspect ratio in the window
               (although not its natural size) by setting this keyword.
               The image width is fitted first. If, after setting the
               image width, the image height is too big for the window,
               then the image height is fitted into the window. The
               appropriate values of the POSITION keyword are honored
               during this fitting process. Once a fit is made, the
               POSITION coordiates are re-calculated to center the image
               in the window. You can recover these new position coordinates
               as the output from the POSITION keyword.

     MARGIN:   A single value, expressed as a normalized coordinate, that
               can easily be used to calculate a position in the window.
               The margin is used to calculate a POSITION that gives
               the image an equal margin around the edge of the window.
               The margin must be a number in the range 0.0 to 0.333. This
               keyword is ignored if the POSITION or OVERPLOT keywords are
               used. It is also ignored when TVImage is executed in a
               multi-plot window, EXCEPT if it's value is zero. In this
               special case, the image will be drawn into its position in
               the multi-plot window with no margins whatsoever. (The
               default is to have a slight margin about the image to separate
               it from other images or graphics.

     MINUS_ONE: The value of this keyword is passed along to the CONGRID
               command. It prevents CONGRID from adding an extra row and
               column to the resulting array, which can be a problem with
               small image arrays.

     NOINTERPOLATION: Setting this keyword disables the default bilinear
               interpolation done to the image when it is resized. Nearest
               neighbor interpolation is done instead. This is preferred
               when you do not wish to change the pixel values of the image.
               This keyword must be set, for example, when you are displaying
               GIF files that come with their own non-IDL color table vectors.

     NORMAL:   Setting this keyword means image position coordinates x and y
               are interpreted as being in normalized coordinates. This keyword
               is only valid if the TV keyword is set.

     OVERPLOT: Setting this keyword causes the POSITION keyword to be ignored
               and the image is positioned in the location established by the
               last graphics command. For example:

                    Plot, Findgen(11), Position=[0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 0.95]
                    TVImage, image, /Overplot

     POSITION: The location of the image in the output window. This is
               a four-element floating array of normalized coordinates of
               the type given by !P.POSITION or the POSITION keyword to
               other IDL graphics commands. The form is [x0, y0, x1, y1].
               The default is [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. Note that this keyword is ALSO
               an output keyword. That is to say, upon return from TVIMAGE
               this keyword (if passed by reference) contains the actual
               position in the window where the image was displayed. This
               may be different from the input values if the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
               keyword is set, or if you are using TVIMAGE with the POSITION
               keyword when !P.MULTI is set to something other than a single
               plot. One use for the output values might be to position other
               graphics (e.g., a colorbar) in relation to the image.

               Note that the POSITION keyword should not, normally, be used
               when displaying multiple images with !P.MULTI. If it *is* used,
               its meaning differs slightly from its normal meaning. !P.MULTI
               is responsible for calculating the position of graphics in the
               display window. Normally, it would be a mistake to use a POSITION
               graphics keyword on a graphics command that was being drawn with
               !P.MULTI. But in this special case, TVIMAGE will use the POSITION
               coordinates to calculate an image position in the actual position
               calculated for the image by !P.MULTI. The main purpose of this
               functionality is to allow the user to display images along with
               colorbars when using !P.MULTI. See the example below.

     TV:       Setting this keyword makes the TVIMAGE command work much
               like the TV command, although better. That is to say, it
               will still set the correct DECOMPOSED state depending upon
               the kind of image to be displayed (8-bit or 24-bit). It will
               also allow the image to be "positioned" in the window by
               specifying the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the
               image. The NORMAL keyword is activated when the TV keyword
               is set, which will indicate that the position coordinates
               are given in normalized coordinates rather than device
               coordinates.

               Setting this keyword will ensure that the keywords
               KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO, MARGIN, MINUS_ONE, MULTI, and POSITION
               are ignored.

 OUTPUTS:
     None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
     Unless the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is set, the displayed image
     may not have the same aspect ratio as the input data set.

 RESTRICTIONS:
     If the POSITION keyword and the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword are
     used together, there is an excellent chance the POSITION
     parameters will change. If the POSITION is passed in as a
     variable, the new positions will be returned in the same variable
     as an output parameter.

     If a 24-bit image is displayed on an 8-bit display, the
     24-bit image must be converted to an 8-bit image and the
     appropriate color table vectors. This is done with the COLOR_QUAN
     function. The TVIMAGE command will load the color table vectors
     and set the NOINTERPOLATION keyword if this is done. Note that the
     resulting color table vectors are normally incompatible with other
     IDL-supplied color tables. Hence, other graphics windows open at
     the time the image is display are likely to look strange.

 EXAMPLE:
     To display an image with a contour plot on top of it, type:

        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
        image = BYTARR(360,360)
        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
        READU, lun, image
        FREE_LUN, lun

        TVIMAGE, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
        CONTOUR, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /NOERASE, XSTYLE=1, $
            YSTYLE=1, XRANGE=[0,360], YRANGE=[0,360], NLEVELS=10

     To display four images in a window without spacing between them:

     !P.Multi=[0,2,2]
     TVImage, image, Margin=0
     TVImage, image, Margin=0
     TVImage, image, Margin=0
     TVImage, image, Margin=0
     !P.Multi = 0

     To display four image in a window with associated color bars:

     !P.Multi=[0,2,2]
     p = [0.02, 0.3, 0.98, 0.98]
     LoadCT, 0
     TVImage, image, Position=p
     Colorbar, Position=[p[0], p[1]-0.1, p[2], p[1]-0.05]
     p = [0.02, 0.3, 0.98, 0.98]
     LoadCT, 2
     TVImage, image, Position=p
     Colorbar, Position=[p[0], p[1]-0.1, p[2], p[1]-0.05]
     p = [0.02, 0.3, 0.98, 0.98]
     LoadCT, 3
     TVImage, image, Position=p
     Colorbar, Position=[p[0], p[1]-0.1, p[2], p[1]-0.05]
     p = [0.02, 0.3, 0.98, 0.98]
     LoadCT, 5

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
      Written by:     David Fanning, 20 NOV 1996.
      Fixed a small bug with the resizing of the image. 17 Feb 1997. DWF.
      Removed BOTTOM and NCOLORS keywords. This reflects my growing belief
         that this program should act more like TV and less like a "color
         aware" application. I leave "color awareness" to the program
         using TVIMAGE. Added 24-bit image capability. 15 April 1997. DWF.
      Fixed a small bug that prevented this program from working in the
          Z-buffer. 17 April 1997. DWF.
      Fixed a subtle bug that caused me to think I was going crazy!
          Lession learned: Be sure you know the *current* graphics
          window! 17 April 1997. DWF.
      Added support for the PRINTER device. 25 June 1997. DWF.
      Extensive modifications. 27 Oct 1997. DWF
          1) Removed PRINTER support, which didn't work as expected.
          2) Modified Keep_Aspect_Ratio code to work with POSITION keyword.
          3) Added check for window-able devices (!D.Flags AND 256).
          4) Modified PostScript color handling.
      Craig Markwart points out that Congrid adds an extra row and column
          onto an array. When viewing small images (e.g., 20x20) this can be
          a problem. Added a Minus_One keyword whose value can be passed
          along to the Congrid keyword of the same name. 28 Oct 1997. DWF
      Changed default POSITION to fill entire window. 30 July 1998. DWF.
      Made sure color decomposition is OFF for 2D images. 6 Aug 1998. DWF.
      Added limited PRINTER portrait mode support. The correct aspect ratio
          of the image is always maintained when outputting to the
          PRINTER device and POSITION coordinates are ignored. 6 Aug 1998. DWF
      Removed 6 August 98 fixes (Device, Decomposed=0) after realizing that
          they interfere with operation in the Z-graphics buffer. 9 Oct 1998. DWF
      Added a MARGIN keyword. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
      Re-established Device, Decomposed=0 keyword for devices that
         support it. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.

      Added TV keyword to allow TVIMAGE to work like the TV command. 11 May 99. DWF.
      Added the OVERPLOT keyword to allow plotting on POSITION coordinates
         estabished by the preceding graphics command. 11 Oct 99. DWF.
      Added automatic recognition of !P.Multi. Setting MULTI keyword is no
         longer required. 18 Nov 99. DWF.
      Added NOINTERPOLATION keyword so that nearest neighbor interpolation
         is performed rather than bilinear. 3 Dec 99. DWF
      Changed ON_ERROR condition from 1 to 2. 19 Dec 99. DWF.
      Added Craig Markwardt's CMCongrid program and removed RSI's. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.
      Added HALF_HALF keyword to support CMCONGRID. 24 Feb 2000. DWF.

      Small modification at suggestion of Karsten Rodenacker to increase size of
         images in !P.MULTI mode. 8 December 2004. DWF.
      Minor modifications on Karsten Rodenacker's own account concerning margination
         and TV behaviour. 8 December 2004. KaRo
      There was a small inconsistency in how the image was resized for PostScript as
         opposed to the display, which could occasionally result in a small black line
         to the right of the image. This is now handled consistently. 3 January 2007. DWF.
      Made a small change to CMCONGRID to permit nearest-neighbor interpolation for 3D arrays.
         Previously, any 24-bit image was interpolated, no matter the setting of the NOINTERP
         keyword. 22 April 2007. DWF.

 NAME:
        TVMAP

 PURPOSE:
        TVMAP produces one of the following plots:
          (1) A color-pixel image,   overlaid with a world map
          (2) A line-contour plot,   overlaid with a world map
          (3) A filled-contour plot, overlaid with a world map

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TVMAP, Data, [ Xarr, YArr [ [, keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> 2-D array of values to be plotted as a color map.
             The first dimension is longitude, the second is latitude.

        XARR, YARR -> If plotting a line-contour map or filled-contour map,
             then XARR is the array of X-axis values, and YARR is the
             array of Y-Axis values that are needed to construct the
             the contours.  XARR and YARR are not needed to produce a
             color-pixel image map; however, if XARR and YARR are
             passed, TVMAP will be able to label the longitude and
             latitude lines accordingly and set the proper default limits.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        BLACK -> The color index corresponding to black.
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK.

        /CONUS -> a Lambert's azimuthal equal area projection for
             CONtiguous U.S., w/ specific LIMIT and P0lat, P0lon, Rot.

        MAX_VALID -> maximum valid data value for color-pixel plots
             Data above MAX_VALID will be shown in white, unless
             TOPOUTOFRANGE is set to another color index.

        MIN_VALID -> minimum valid data value for color-pixel plots.  
             (or minimum contour level for contour plots).  Data 
             below MIN_VALID will be shown in white, unless
             BOTOUTOFRANGE is set to another color index.

        TOPOUTOFRANGE ( BOTOUTOFRANGE ) -> color index to indicate
             data above MAX_VALID (below MIN_VALID). Default is
             white. The color is also shown with a box (or TRiangle)
             near the colorbar (if any). If negative, the box is not
             shown with the colorbar.

        /NOERASE -> This keyword prevents erasing the screen (or page)
            when setting a multi-panel environment or after a page was
            filled.  /NOERASE is automatically turned ON when the /OFF
            keyword is given.  NOTE: On the PostScript device, when
            the page is filled, it automatically places the next plot
            on the next page.  You can use the /NOERASE keyword to
            suppress this behavior, especially if you are manually
            placing plots on the page.

        CSFAC -> Character size for the map labels and X, Y titles.
             Default settings for CSFAC vary according to the number
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        TCSFAC -> Character size for the top title.  Default
             settings for TCSFAC vary according to the number
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        /NOADVANCE -> Set this switch to prevent TVMAP from advancing
             to the next plot panel on the page.  This is useful if
             you desire to overplot something atop the pixel map or
             contour map.

        /POLYFILL -> to use IDL POLYFILL routine instead of MAP_IMAGE
             to do the pixel plot (see /SAMPLE). Use this keyword
             with default cylindrical projection only. Use it also if
             you think that MAP_IMAGE does not neatly reproduces the
             boxes.

        /RECTANGLE -> to plot a rectangle around the map. Default is
             to have one for non-polar projection, and none for polar 
             projection. Set to 0 or 1 to override default.  NOTE:
             setting the /HORIZON keyword will disable this option.

        /SAMPLE -> to do "pixel plot" (ie grid boxes are colored)
             instead of contour. 

        /HORIZON -> Set this switch to call IDL routine MAP_HORIZON
             to draw a horizon line around the boundaries of the map.
             Use this feature if the map projection you are using is
             elliptical or interrupted.  NOTE: /HORIZON will override
             override the /RECTANGLE keyword setting.

        WINDOWPOSITION -> Returns the position of the plot window
             in normal coordinates to the calling program.  This can
             be used by a subsequent call to PLOT if you want to
             overplot symbols atop the contour or pixel plot created
             by TVMAP.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords (not listed below, unless
             noted) for BYTSCL, COLORBAR, TVIMAGE, MAP_SET, MAP_GRID,
             MAP_CONTINENTS, MAP_LABELS and CONTOUR.

    Keywords passed to both BYTSCL and COLORBAR:
    ============================================
        MAXDATA -> Maximum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is max( DATA ).

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is min( DATA ).

        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be used
             for byte-scaling the color map and colorbar.  Default
             is 20 (or !D.N_COLORS-1 if 20 is too large).

        NCOLORS -> This is the maximum color index that will be used.
             Default is 120 (or !D.N_COLORS-BOTTOM, if 120 is too large).

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are quasi-logarithmic.

    Additional keywords passed to COLORBAR:
    =======================================
        /CBAR -> If set, will plot a horizontal colorbar below the
             map in the position specified by CBPOSITION.  Default is
             to NOT plot a colorbar.

        CBCOLOR -> Color index of the colorbar outline and
             characters.  Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        CBPOSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the colorbar.  CBPOSITION
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot.
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08].

        CBUNIT -> Passes the Unit string to COLORBAR, which will be
             plotted to the right of the color bar.

        CBFORMAT -> format to use in call to colorbar. Default is I12
             if abs(max(data)) < 1e4, else e12.2 (strings get trimmed)

        CBMIN, CBMAX -> Explicitly sets the min and max values of
             the colorbar range.  If not set, TVMAP will set
             CBMIN = min( DATA ) and CBMAX = max( DATA ).

        CBTICKLEN -> Specifies the color bar tick length as a
             fraction of the colorbar height (for horizontal
             colorbars) or width (for vertical colorbars).

        CBVERTICAL -> If set, will plot a vertical bar on the right
             side of the map.

        CBSCALE -> If set, then the printed tick labels are scaled by
             powers of 10 to minimize overlap.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels for the colorbar.  Default is 4.

        /TRIANGLE -> to replace box that indicate Out Of Range data 
             with a triangle.

        TOPLEVELVALUE -> to define the last annotation of the
             colorbar when using the C_LEVELS keyword

    Keywords passed to MAP_SET:
    ===========================
        COLOR -> Color index of the map outline and title characters.
             Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        MPARAM -> A 3 element vector containing values for
             [ P0Lat, P0Lon, Rot ].  Default is [ 0, 0, 0 ].
             Elements not specified are automatically set to zero.

        /ISOTROPIC  -> If set, will produce a map with the same scale
             in the X and Y directions.  Default is not to plot an
             isotropic-scale map. Note, however, that if TVMAP is
             called from CTM_PLOT, the default is to plot a map that
             keeps the aspect ratio (which is about the same as
             isotropic).

        LIMIT -> A four-element vector which specifies the latitude
             and longitude extent of the map.  The elements of LIMIT
             are arranged thus: [ LatMin, LonMin, LatMax, LonMax ].
             Default is to set LIMIT = [ -90, -180, 90, 180 ] (i.e.
             to include the entire globe). P0Lon will be computed
             to fit into the LIMIT range unless it is explicitely
             requested in MParam.

        POLAR -> Plot a polar stereographic projection. If set and
             equal 1 then the plot goes from the pole to a latitude
             defined by either the extend of the data or by the user
             through the LIMIT keyword. If set and equal to 2, then
             the full hemisphere is plot, regardless of the data or
             LIMIT settings.
              Note that setting the /STEREOGRAPHIC keyword wouldn't
             work.

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot.
             Default is [0.0, 0.15, 1.0, 1.0] with Horizontal Color
             Bar, and [0., 0., 0.82, 1.0] with Vertical CBar.

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible"
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in
            subsequent plot commands.  MARGIN can either be one value
            which will be applied to all four margins, or a 2-element
            vector which results in equal values for the left and
            right and equal values for the bottom and top margins,
            or a 4-element vector with [left,bottom,right,top].  The
            default MARGIN setting is [ 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.07 ].

        OMARGIN -> specify a page margin around all panels in normalized
            coordinates. Works like MARGIN.

        SCALEMAPSET -> To pass the SCALE keyword to MAP_SET.

        TITLE -> The title string that is to be placed atop the
             plot window.  TITLE is passed explicitly to avoid keyword
             name duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.


    Keywords passed to MAP_LABELS:
    ==================================
    
        LATS, LONS -> Array of latitudes (longitudes) used to
            construct the map labels.  If LATS has one element, the
            LATS vector is build with LATS+n*DLAT, with as n as
            needed to cover the map range. If it has more than one
            element, it is not modified and it is the final grid.

        DLAT, DLON -> Latitude (longitude) interval between grid
            lines. Passed with _extra.


    Keywords passed to MAP_CONTINENTS:
    ==================================
        /CONTINENTS -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to plot
             continent outlines or filled boundaries.  Default is 0.

        /COUNTRIES -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to draw the
             political boundaries of countries as of 1993.

        /COASTS -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to draw the coast
             lines of continental regions.

        CCOLOR -> The color index of the continent outline or fill
             region.  Default is BLACK (see above).

        CFILL -> Value passed to FILL_CONTINENTS keyword of MAP_CONTINENTS.
             If CFILL=1 then will fill continents with a solid color
             (as specified in CCOLOR above).  If CFILL=2 then will fill
             continents with hatching.

        /USA -> Set this switch to turn on US State boundaries.

    Keywords passed to MAP_GRID:
    ============================
        /BOX_AXES -> If set, then MAP_GRID will print alternating
             light & dark regions with the lon & lat labels around
             the border of the plot.  This is passed directly to
             MAP_GRID.  NOTE: BOX_AXES is the default for the CONUS
             option.

        /GRID -> If set, will call MAP_GRID to plot grid lines and
             labels. Labels can be turned off with /NOGLABELS.
             Default is _not_ to plot grid lines.

        GCOLOR -> The color index of the grid lines. Default is
             BLACK (see above).

        /NOGXLABELS -> If set, TVMAP will suppress printing longitude
             labels for each grid line.

        /NOGYLABELS -> If set, TVMAP will suppress printing latitude
             labels for each grid line.

    Keywords passed to CONTOUR:
    ===========================
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled-contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, will use preset default levels.

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for contour lines or
             fill regions.  If not specified then will use uniformly
             spaced default color levels.  If C_COLORS is set to a
             scalar value, then all contour lines will have the same
             color value.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector,
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise,
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling.

        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.

    Keywords passed to MAP_IMAGE (prior: to REBIN):
    ==============================================
        /SAMPLE -> Used to rebin the byte-scaled image array to a
             larger size.  If /SAMPLE is set, then MAP_IMAGE will use
             nearest-neighbor sampling rather than bilinear
             interpolation. 

    Keyword passed to TVIMAGE:
    ===============================================
        SCALEMAPIMAGE -> Sets the number of pixels per graphic coordinate
             in PostScript and other devices with scalable
             pixels. Larger values produce better resolution output,
             but much larger file sizes. The default value is
             0.04. Use a larger number for higher resolution if your 
             image does not exactly fit on the map projection. 

 OUTPUTS:
        None

        (1) The _EXTRA facility now picks up keywords for multiple
        routines (this is a new feature in IDL v. 5.0+!!)

        (2) Some keywords are saved in local variables with
        slightly different names (e.g. MCONTOUR for /CONTOUR)
        to prevent confusion with routine names and/or keywords
        that are picked up by the _EXTRA=e facility.

        (4) For contour plots, contour labels will be specified
        using the C_ANNOTATION keyword.  The downside is that
        by using C_ANNOTATION, this disables the C_LABELS keyword
        and so one cannot specify which contour lines will get
        labels.  The solution would be to expand the C_LABELS
        vector so that it has the same number of elements as
        C_ANNOTATION, and then to individually zero the
        corresponding elements of C_ANNOTATION before making
        the contour plot.  Don't have enough time for this now,
        but maybe can deal with this at a later time...

        (5) Now references the !MYCT system variable.  This should
        be defined at the start of your IDL session when "myct.pro"
        is called from "idl_startup.pro".

 LIMITATIONS:

       (1) The case of plot over the dateline is working fine only if
       LIMIT[3] is negative and LIMIT[1] is positive. Other cases are
       not specifically handled and results may not be reliable.


       (2) Since we are using MAP_IMAGE, pixel plots do start and end
        at longitude and latitude centers of the grid by default,
        like contour plots. More map coverage is done in three cases:

          (2a) Data sets that cover the globe will fill the map with
          coarse pixel plots.
         
          (2b) Data sets that cover the globe will fill the map only
          in the longitude direction with smooth pixel and contour
          plot. Plots start and stop at the first and last latitudes
          centers.
         
          (2c) Data sets that do not cover the globe will start and
          end at grid edges with coarse pixels, only if the limit of
          the map is less than half grid size away from the the
          first/last latitude and longitude centers. This limitation
          is due to the method used to pad the data outside the
          domain delimited by X/Y arrays.

       (3) MAP_IMAGE assumes that an evenly spaced data set is
       passed. If X or Y array is not evenly spaced, pixels plots are
       flawed and not reliable. Contour plots are ok.

                          - a border is now plotted around the
                            map window, without inserting any of that
                            annoying "cushion" space.
                          - added LOG keyword for logarithmic
                            contours and/or pixel colors
                          - use KEYWORD_SET more often
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998: - re-arranged calls to map_set and tvimage
                            in order to maximize size
                          - output of title now seperate from map_set

        bmy, 08 Feb 1999: - If /LOG is set, make sure that we don't
                            take the log of zero and incur a math error
                          - add call to function INV_INDEX
        bmy, 23 Feb 1999: - added /GLABELS keyword to turn on/off printing
                            of labels for each grid line on the map
                          - added call to CONVERT_LON for longitudes
                            that straddle the date line
        bmy, 26 Feb 1999: - added LIMIT as an explicit keyword
                          - now uses MAP_LABELS to construct grid labels

                          - new keyword NOGLABELS
                          - P0Lon now computed from LIMIT information.
                          - Updated call to map_labels
                          - For contour plots: XArr, YArr no longer
                            mandatory (although they should be provided)
                          - much smarter default contour levels
        mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added multi-panel ability through use of
                            the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                            meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now
                            refer to positions in the current plot panel!
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: - fixed a few minor things
                          - charsize is now adjusted according to number
                            of panels on page
        bmy, 25 Mar 1999: - If CBAR=0, then print unit string below
                            plot (formerly was done in CTM_PLOT)
                          - now use updated GET_DEFAULTFORMAT
                          - updated comments
                          - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                            higher above the window, to allow for
                            carriage-returned lines
        mgs, 23 Apr 1999: - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for
                            tighter colorbar control
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - title shifted a little higher if it has
                            more than 1 line.
  bmy & mgs, 26 May 1999: - added POLAR keyword and respective support.
        bmy, 27 May 1999: - bug fix for isotropic contour plots
        mgs, 27 May 1999: - added support for discrete colorbars and
                            changed default behaviour for filled
                            contour plots: now plots a colorbar and
                            no lines.
        bmy, 03 Jun 1999: - For polar plots, if the latitude range
                            spans more than 60 degrees, only plot
                            labels for [ 30, 60, 90 ] degrees.
        mgs, 03 Jun 1999: - CFill now also allowed for filled contours
                            or pixel plots (data will be overplotted)
        bmy, 09 Jun 1999: - Set CBUnit to '' if nothing passed
        bmy, 21 Jun 1999: - Added MIN_VALID keyword.
        bmy, 06 Jul 1999: - bug fix for min_valid: ge replaces gt.
        bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                            define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                            appear in Postscript plots
                          - multi-panel plots are now well-separated
                            from each other (for PostScript output)
        bmy, 08 Jul 1999: - more minor fixes
        bmy, 18 Nov 1999: - increase default left margin by a little
        bmy, 31 Mar 2000: GAMAP VERSION 1.45
                          - make CSFAC and TITLECSFAC into keywords
        bmy, 10 May 2000: - make sure XARR and YARR (if passed) are 1D vectors
                          - now use XARR, YARR to set default limits
                          - rearranged keyword settings code for clarity
                          - added more debug output (when /DEBUG is set)
        bmy, 26 May 2000: - updated comments
        bmy, 13 Jun 2000: - added /COUNTRIES and /COASTS keywords.
                            Setting /COUNTRIES, /COASTS, or /CONTINENTS
                            will now invoke routine MAP_CONTINENTS
        bmy, 30 Jan 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.47
                          - if NOGLABELS=0 and GRID=0, will print out
                            grid labels w/o printing out grid lines
                          - added MARGIN keyword for MULTIPANEL
                          - also allow coarse plots with /SAMPLE

        bmy, 07 Jun 2001: - removed some obsolete code & comments
        bmy, 02 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48
                          - added /NOGXLABELS and /NOGYLABELS keywords
                            to suppress printing either lon or lat
                            grid labels, if so desired.
        bmy, 13 Jul 2001: - bug fix: remove _EXTRA=e from MAP_SET call
                            when making pixel plots.  This prevents extra
                            grid lines from being drawn on the map.
        bmy, 23 Jul 2001: - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                            values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                            if these keywords are not passed explicitly.
        bmy, 31 Oct 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.49
                          - add /NOADVANCE keyword to prevent advancing
                            to the next page (in case you want to overplot)
        bmy, 08 May 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.50
                          - If the data array has more than 100,000 elements,
                            then assign it a dithering factor of 1, so that
                            we don't run out of memory when trying to plot it
        bmy, 20 Jun 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                          - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword to return
                            the position vector of the plot window
                            region to the calling program
        bmy, 28 Sep 2002: - now gets MYCT default parameters from the
                            !MYCT system variable
        bmy, 10 Oct 2002: - bug fix: MCOLOR=!MYCT.BLACK setting has
                            now been restored (was left commented out)
        bmy, 14 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                          - If GLABELS=0, then this also sets GXLABELS=0
                            and GYLABELS=0.
                          - Removed obsolete keywords
                          - Removed reference to MYCT_DEFAULTS.
        bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                          - added OMARGIN keyword so that we can put
                            an outer margin around all plot panels
        bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                            C_COLORS to the calling program
                          - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the

                            all 4 types of plots.
                          - now data Latitudes and Longitudes (X/Yarr)
                            are taken into account in Pixel
                            plot: no more need to clip the data
                            before plotting, TVMAP will do it, like
                            it already does for Contour plots.
                          - added Full Hemisphere Polar plot option,
                            regardless of DATA range and LIMIT keyword
                          - added RECTANGLE keyword to overwrite

                          - Fixes for MIN_VALID and MAX_VALID 
                          - The test for the LIMIT keyword is now to check
                            "if ( n_elements(limit) ne 4 )".  This allows you
                            to disable the LIMIT keyword by also setting
                            LIMIT=0.
        phs, 28 Feb 2008: - Couple of small padding improvements
                          - added SCALEMAPSET and SCALEMAPIMAGE to pass
                            their respective SCALE keyword to MAP_SET and
                            MAP_IMAGE.
                          - LONS and LATS keyword added, so the grid can
                            be specified. Work with DLAT and DLON, the
                            grid spacings that can be passed to MAP_LABELS
                            thru the _extra keyword.
  cdh & phs, 21 Mar 2008: - added minimum support for LIMIT input as
                            8-elements vector
        phs, 17 Apr 2008: - Added the TopOutOfRange and BotOutOfRange
                            keywords, so default color (white) for Out-Of
                            -Range data can be overwritten.
        phs,  6 May 2008: - Added the GXLABELS and GYLABELS keywords
                            to specify which grid line to label.
        phs, 19 Jun 2008: - Set default SCALE value for MapImage
                            (ScaleMapImage keyword) to 0.04 if PS device.
        phs, 25 Mar 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Added NAN_COLOR to specify color to use
                            for NaN and Infinite data 
 cdh, eml, phs, 19 Sep 2009: - Now C_LEVELS works with pixel plots and
                            any projection.
                          - Added LATS, LONS (to specify the grid), and
                            TOPLEVELVALUE (to specify the last level
                            in the colorbar when using C_LEVELS)
                            keywords
                          - fixed limit of CONUS projection
        phs, 29 Oct 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.14
                          - added the polyfill keyword

 NAME:
        TVPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        TVPLOT produces one of the following plots:
          (1) A color-pixel image,   overlaid atop X-Y plot axes
          (2) A line-contour plot,   overlaid atop X-Y plot axes
          (3) A filled-contour plot, overlaid atop X-Y plot axes

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TVPLOT, Data, Xarr, Yarr, [, keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> 2-D array of values to be plotted.
        
        XARR -> array of X-axis (horizontal axis) values needed to
             construct the plot.  The number of elements in XARR must
             equal the number of elements of the first dimension of DATA.

        ZARR -> ZARR is the array of Z-axis (vertical axis) values
             needed to construct the plot.  The number of elements
             in ZARR must equal the number of elements of the second
             dimension of DATA.  If ZARR[0] > ZARR[N_Elements(ZARR)-1]
             then TVPLOT will assume pressure is to be plotted on the
             Y-axis.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        BLACK -> The color index corresponding to black.
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK (from !MYCT system variable.)

        /NOERASE -> This keyword prevents erasing the screen (or page)
            when setting a multi-panel environment or after a page was
            filled.  /NOERASE is automatically turned ON when the /OFF
            keyword is given.  NOTE: On the PostScript device, when
            the page is filled, it automatically places the next plot
            on the next page.  You can use the /NOERASE keyword to
            suppress this behavior, especially if you are manually
            placing plots on the page.
 
        CSFAC -> Character size for the map labels and plot titles. 
             Default settings for CSFAC vary according to the number 
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        /NOADVANCE -> Set this switch to prevent TVMAP from advancing
             to the next plot panel on the page.  This is useful if
             you desire to overplot something atop the pixel plot or
             contour plot.

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible"
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in
            subsequent plot commands.  MARGIN can either be one value
            which will be applied to all four margins, or a 2-element
            vector which results in equal values for the left and
            right and equal values for the bottom and top margins,
            or a 4-element vector with [left,bottom,right,top].  The
            default MARGIN setting is [ 0.05, 0.04, 0.00, 0.02 ].
            -> adds 0.02 to the left margin for Y-axis title
            -> adds 0.03 to the bottom margin for X-axis title
            -> adds 0.03 to the right margin for vertical color bar
            -> adds 0.02 to the top margin for more than 2 plots/page

        OMARGIN -> specify a page margin around all panels in normalized
            coordinates. Works like MARGIN.

        WINDOWPOSITION -> Returns the position of the plot window
             in normal coordinates to the calling program.  This can
             be used by a subsequent call to PLOT if you want to
             overplot symbols atop the contour or pixel plot created
             by TVPLOT.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords (not listed below) for
             BYTSCL, COLORBAR, TVIMAGE, MAP_SET, MAP_GRID,
             MAP_CONTINENTS, and CONTOUR.


    Keywords for both BYTSCL and COLORBAR:
    ======================================
        MAXDATA -> Maximum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is max( DATA ).

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is min( DATA ).

        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be used
             for byte-scaling the color map and colorbar.  Default 
             is !MYCT.BOTTOM (from the !MYCT system variable).

        NCOLORS -> This is the maximum color index that will be used.
             Default is !MYCT.NCOLOR (from the !MYCT system variable).

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are logarithmic.


    Additional keywords for COLORBAR:
    =================================
        /CBAR -> If set, will plot the colorbar below the map in the 
             position specified by CBPOSITION.  Default is to NOT
             plot a colorbar.
 
        CBCOLOR -> Color index of the colorbar outline and
             characters.  Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        CBPOSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the colorbar.  CBPOSITION 
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08]. 

        CBUNIT -> Passes the Unit string to COLORBAR, which will be
             plotted to the right of the color bar.

        CBFORMAT -> format to use in call to colorbar. Default is I12
             if abs(max(data)) < 1e4, else e12.2 (strings get trimmed)

        CBMIN, CBMAX -> Explicitly sets the min and max values of
             the colorbar range.  If not set, TVPLOT will set 
             CBMIN = min( DATA ) and CBMAX = max( DATA ).

        CBTICKLEN -> Specifies the color bar tick length as a
             fraction of the colorbar height (for horizontal
             colorbars) or width (for vertical colorbars).

        CBSCALE -> If set, then the printed tick labels are scaled by
             powers of 10 to minimize overlap.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels for the colorbar.  Default is 4.

        /CBVERTICAL -> Will draw a vertical colorbar instead of
             a horizontal one.  Default is to draw a horizontal
             colorbar.


    Keywords for INTERPOLATION:
    ===========================
    
        /SAMPLE -> Used to get COARSE pixel plot. REBIN is called,
             and uses the nearest-neighbor sampling.
             Note that REBIN is used even if SAMPLE is not set, when
             device is PostScript. It uses the bilinear interpolation
             then.

        /NOZINTERP -> set to switch off the vertical
             interpolation. This can be used only if the ZARR is
             evenly spaced.


    Keywords for PLOT:
    ===================

        BOTOUTOFRANGE -> Color index for data below
             MIN_VALID. Default is white, or last color in color
             table if !MYCT is not defined. If set to negative, the
             color is used in the plot only, and not in the colorbar. 

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]. 

        TITLE -> The title string that is to be placed atop the
             plot window.  TITLE is passed explicitly to avoid keyword
             name duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.
  
        COLOR -> Color index for the plot window outline and titles.  
             Default is BLACK.

        XSTYLE, YSTYLE -> Style settings for the X and Y axes.  See 
             the "Graphics Keywords" settings man page for more info.
             XSTYLE and YSTYLE are passed as explicit keywords to
             avoid keyword name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        XRANGE, YRANGE -> Two-element vectors for the X-axis and Y-axis 
             plot ranges, of the form [Xmin,Xmax] and [YMin,Ymax].
             XRANGE and YRANGE are passed as explicit keywords to
             avoid keyword name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        XTITLE, YTITLE -> Titles for the X and Y axes.  XTITLE and 
             YTITLE are passed as explicit keywords to avoid keyword 
             name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        NOXLABEL, NOYLABEL -> Suppress printing tick labels for X and Y axes.


    Keywords for CONTOUR:
    =====================
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the 
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled-contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, will use preset default levels (see below).

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for contour lines or
             fill regions.  If not specified then will use uniformly
             spaced default color levels.  If C_COLORS is set to a 
             scalar value, then all contour lines will have the same
             color value.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS 
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector, 
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS 
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise, 
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the 
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to 
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling.
 
        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.


 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==================================================
        COLORBAR              GET_DEFAULTFORMAT (function)        
        INV_INDEX (function)  LOGLEVELS (function)  
        TVIMAGE          
        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        Assumes that a MYCT colortable has been loaded.

 NOTES:
        (1) The _EXTRA facility picks extra keywords for BYTSCL,
            TVIMAGE, PLOT and COLORBAR, etc...  This is a new 
            feature in IDL v. 5.0+!! 

        (2) For contour plots, contour labels will be specified
            using the C_ANNOTATION keyword.  The downside is that
            by using C_ANNOTATION, this disables the C_LABELS keyword
            and so one cannot specify which contour lines will get
            labels.  The solution would be to expand the C_LABELS
            vector so that it has the same number of elements as
            C_ANNOTATION, and then to individually zero the
            corresponding elements of C_ANNOTATION before making
            the contour plot.  Don't have enough time for this now,
            but maybe can deal with this at a later time...

 EXAMPLE:
        POSITION   = [0.1, 0.1,  0.9, 0.9 ] ; position for map
        CBPOSITION = [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08] ; position for colorbar

        TVPLOT, DATA, XARR, YARR,                           $
               MAXDATA=MAXDATA,    MINDATA=MINDATA,         $
               POSITION=POSITION,  CBPOSITION=CBPOSITION,   $
               /ERASE,             TITLE='Avg O3',          $
               XTITLE='Longitude', YTITLE='Altitude',       $
               DIVISIONS=4,        FORMAT='(F6.2)'

        mgs, 15 Jun 1998:  - bug fix n_elements instead of keyword_set
                           - now does spline interpolation in the
                             vertical in order to get correct
                             altitudes
        bmy, 21 Sep 1998:  - Rename EXTRA1, EXTRA2, etc, to names
                             that have more meaning (e.g. E_BYT for
                             BytScl, E_TV for TVImage, etc.)
        bmy, 22 Sep 1998:  VERSION 1.10
                           - now uses _EXTRA=e facility to pass extra
                             keywords to BYTSCL, TVIMAGE, PLOT, and
                             COLORBAR.
                           - add PLOTTITLE (for PLOT) and UNIT (for
                             COLORBAR) keywords to prevent keyword
                             name duplication in _EXTRA=e.
        mgs, 11 Nov 1998:  - added CBar keyword
        bmy, 16 Nov 1998:  VERSION 2.00
                           - now can produce line-contour and filled-
                             contour plots as well as image plots
                           - now calls REBIN to rebin the byte-scaled
                             image array to higher resolution for
                             PostScript output.
                           - added the following keywords: /LOG,
                             /SAMPLE, /CONTOUR, /FCONTOUR, C_ANNOTATION,
                             C_LEVELS, C_LABELS, /NOLABELS, /NOLINES, 
        bmy, 17 Nov 1998:  - For image plots, now only display plot axes
                             AFTER the image plot has been made.  This
                             reduces the "apparent" wait time for the 
                             user.
                           - renamed keywords to XA_TITLE, XA_RANGE, 
                             XA_TICKNAME, etc to avoid keyword name
                             duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998:  - added CBFormat keyword
        bmy, 18 Nov 1998:  - also added floating point format for 
                             CBFORMAT when abs(max(Data)) < 10
        mgs, 19 Nov 1998:  - CBFormat no whandled in colorbar.pro
        bmy, 27 Jan 1999:  - added defaults for XRANGE and YRANGE
        bmy, 08 Jan 1999:  - If /LOG is set, make sure that we don't
                             take the log of zero and incur a math error
                           - add call to function INV_INDEX  
        mgs, 18 Mar 1999:  - cleaned up
                           - now uses loglevels and has smarter default 
                             contour levels
        mgs, 22 Mar 1999:  - added multi-panel ability through use of
                             the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                             meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now
                             refer to positions in the current plot panel!
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999:  - fixed a few minor things
                           - charsize is now adjusted according to number
                             of panels on page
        bmy, 25 Mar 1999:  - now use updated GET_DEFAULTFORMAT
                           - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                             higher above the window, to allow for 
                             carriage-returned lines
                           - updated comments
        bmy, 27 Apr 1999:  - commented out !x.charsize=csfac and
                             !y.charsize=csfac lines...these messed
                             up the plot window sizes
                           - updated comments
        bmy, 28 Apr 1999:  - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for 
                             tighter colorbar control
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - title shifted a little higher if it has
                            more than 1 line.
        mgs, 21 May 1999: - variable name for TITLE now MTITLE as in
                            TVMAP.
        mgs, 27 May 1999: - changed default behaviour for filled contours:
                            now plots "discrete" colorbar and no lines.
                            Keyword NoLines changed to C_Lines.
        bmy, 10 Jun 1999: - CBUnit defaults to '
        mgs, 06 Jul 1999: - adjusted charsize for multipanel plots
        bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                            define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                            appear in Postscript plots
                          - multi-panel plots are now well-separated
                            from each other (for PostScript output)
        bmy, 08 Jul 1999: - more minor fixes
        bmy, 18 Nov 1999: - increase default left margin by a little
        bmy, 31 Mar 2000: GAMAP VERSION 1.45
                          - made CSFAC a keyword
        bmy, 23 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48
                          - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                            values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                            if these keywords are not passed explicitly.
        bmy, 07 Jul 2001: - removed obsolete code from 1998 and 1999
        bmy, 31 Oct 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.49
                          - add /NOADVANCE keyword to prevent advancing
                            to the next page (in case you want to overplot)
        bmy, 28 Sep 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                          - now gets MYCT default parameters from the
                            !MYCT system variable
        bmy, 15 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                          - Added MIN_VALID keyword to skip missing
                            data values for pixel plots
        bmy, 18 Dec 2003: - For pixel plots, now linearly interpolate
                            when creating NDATA instead of using a
                            cubic spline.  This is more accurate.
                          - Prevent NDATA from being extrapolated wildly
                            due to the slope at the surface and top level
                            of the plot.  
        bmy, 06 Jan 2003: - Now interpolate NDATA correctly when pressure
                            or altitude is on the Y-axis.
                          - Removed obsolete keywords XA_TITLE, YA_TITLE,
                          - XA_RANGE, YA_RANGE, XA_TICKNAME, YA_TICKNAME
                          - Now define default YRANGE = [ ZBOT, ZTOP ]
                            to make Y-axis labels correct for both pressure
                            and altitude on the Y-axis.
                          - Removed ZBOT, ZTOP from the keyword list; 
                            these are now internal variables. 
                          - updated comments
        bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                          - added MARGIN keyword a la TVMAP
                          - added OMARGIN keyword
        bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                            C_COLORS to the calling program
                          - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the
                            color bar tick length
        bmy, 30 Nov 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword  
        bmy, 12 Jul 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - added /ISOTROPIC keyword
                          - added /NOZINTERP keyword to prevent interpolation
                            to a fine grid of 100 pts in the vertical dim.
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
  bmy & phs, 26 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                          - Minor fix for margins w/ for new TVIMAGE
                          - Also reset !P.MULTI=0 when using TVIMAGE
                            so that it will use the internally computed
                            position vector.  Reset after TVIMAGE call.
                          - Make sure to label last colorbar division
                            for contour plots
                          - Vertical colorbar options and MIN_VALID, 
                            MAX_VALID keywords are the same as TVMAP
                          - Extra space is now added to the default
                            MARGIN values for vertical colorbar
                            and multiple plots per page.
                          - Adjust default CBPOSITION values such
                            that the colorbar will be placed either
                            0.05 below or 0.02 to the right of the plot
        phs, 04 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - now produces a better coarse pixel plot
                            for altitude vs latitude or longitude
                            plots, even though the initial box size
                            is not exactly reproduced. 
 cdh, eml, phs, 24 Sep 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - fixes for LOG10 plots

                            direction
                          - C_LEVELS works with /SAMPLE
                          - added checks on NAN when looking at
                            min/max, added NAN_COLOR to specify a
                            color for NaN
                          - added BOTOUTOFRANGE to set color of data
                            below Min_Valid
                          - check if !MYCT is defined
 xyue & bmy, 24 Jan 2011: GAMAP VERSION 2.15
                          - Replace /ERASE keyword with /NOERASE
                            to facilitate manual positioning of
                            plots.  Pass /NOERASE to MULTIPANEL.
                            This is now consistent w/ TVMAP.

 NAME:
       TVREAD

 PURPOSE:

       To get accurate screen dumps with the IDL command TVRD on 24-bit
       PC and Macintosh computers, you have to be sure to set color
       decomposition on. This program adds that capability automatically.
       In addition, the program will optionally write BMP, GIF, JPEG,
       PICT, PNG, and TIFF color image files of the screen dump.

 CATEGORY:
       Graphics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

       image = TVREAD(xstart, ystart, ncols, nrows)

       The returned image will be a 2D image on 8-bit systems and
       a 24-bit pixel interleaved true-color image on 24-bit systems.
       A -1 will be returned if a file output keyword is used (e.g.,
       JPEG, TIFF, etc.).

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

       XSTART -> The starting column index.  By default, 0.

       YSTART -> The starting row index. By default, 0.

       NCOLS -> The number of columns to read. By default, !D.X_Size - XSTART

       NROWS -> The number of rows to read. By default, !D.Y_Size - YSTART.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

       BMP -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color BMP file.

       CANCEL -> An output keyword set to 1 if the user cancels out of a
             filename dialog. Set to 0 otherwise.

       COLORS -- If a 24-bit image has to be quantized, this will set
             the number of colors in the output image. Set to 256 by 
             default. Applies to BMP, GIF, PICT, and PNG formats
             written from 24-bit displays.  (See the COLOR_QUAN 
             documentation for details.)

       CUBE -> If this keyword is set to a value between 2 and 6 the 
             color quantization will use a cubic method of
             quantization. Applies to BMP, GIF, PICT, and PNG formats 
             written from 24-bit displays.  (See the  COLOR_QUAN 
             documentation for details.)

       DITHER -> If this keyword is set the quantized image will be 
             dithered.  Applies to BMP, GIF, PICT, and PNG formats 
             written from 24-bit displays.  (See the COLOR_QUAN 
             documentation for details.)

       FILENAME -> The base name of the output file. (No file extensions;
             they will be added automatically.) This name may be
             changed by the user.

                image = TVREAD(Filename='myfile', /JPEG)

             No file will be written unless a file output keyword is 
             used (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.) in the call. By default
             the FILENAME is set to "idl". The file extension will be 
             set automatically to match the type of file created.

       GIF -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color 
             GIF file.

       JPEG -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color 
             JPEG file.

       ORDER -> Set this keyword to determine the image order for 
           reading the display. Corresponds to !Order and set to such 
           as the default.

       PICT -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color 
            PICT file.

       PNG -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color 
            PNG file.

       TIFF -> Set this keyword to write the screen dump as a color 
            TIFF file.

       TRUE -> Set this keyword to the type of interleaving you
            want. 1 = Pixel interleaved, 2 = row interleaved, 
            3 = band interleaved.

       TYPE -> Can be set to the type of file to write. Use this 
            instead of setting BMP, GIF, JPEG, PICT, PNG, or TIFF 
            keywords: TYPE='JPEG'.  The primary purpose of this is to 
            make event handlers easier to write.

       QUALITY -> This keyword sets the amount of compression for 
           JPEG images.  It should be set to a value between 0 and
           100.  It is set to 75 by default.  (See the WRITE_JPEG 
           documentation for details.)

       WID -> The index number of the window to read from. The
           current graphics window (!D.Window) is selected by 
           default. An error is issued if no windows are
           currently open on a device that supports windows.

       _EXTRA -> Any keywords that are appropriate for the 
           WRITE_*** routines are also accepted via keyword 
           inheritance.

 COMMON BLOCKS:

       None

 RESTRICTIONS:   Requires IDL 5.2 and higher.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Written by David W. Fanning, 9 AUG 2000.
       Added changes to make the program more device independent. 16 SEP 2000. DWF.
       Removed GIF file support for IDL 5.4 and above. 18 JAN 2001. DWF.
       Added NODIALOG keyword. 28 MAR 2001. DWF.
       Added an output CANCEL keyword. 29 AUG 2001. DWF.
       Added ERROR_MESSAGE code to file. 17 DEC 2001. DWF.
       Added ORDER keyword. 25 March 2002. DWF.
       Now create 24-bit PNG files if reading from a 24-bit display. 11 May 2002. DWF.
       Now create 24-bit BMP files if reading from a 24-bit display. 23 May 2002. DWF.
       Removed obsolete STR_SEP and replaced with STRSPLIT. 27 Oct 2004. DWF.
       Unleashed the GIF code for IDL 6.2 and above. 10 Nov 2005. DWF.
       Rolled back previous change to IDL 6.1. 24 Jan 2006. DWF.
       Fixed a problem in which 16-bit displays were treated as 24-bit displays,
         and as a result could not produce WHITE colors. Now all 16-bit displays
         are treated as 8-bit displays. It is an ugly trade-off. 24 Jan 2006. DWF.
       Added TYPE keyword 27 Sep 2006. DWF.

 CATEGORY:
       General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       UNDEFINE, variable

 REQUIRED INPUTS:
       variable: The variable to be deleted. Up to 10 variables may be specified as arguments.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       The variable no longer exists.

 EXAMPLE:
       To delete the variable "info", type:

        IDL> Undefine, info

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by David Fanning, 8 June 97, from an original program
       given to me by Andrew Cool, DSTO, Adelaide, Australia.
       Simplified program so you can pass it an undefined variable. :-) 17 May 2000. DWF
       Simplified it even more by removing the unnecessary SIZE function. 28 June 2002. DWF.
       Added capability to delete up to 10 variables at suggestion of Craig Markwardt. 10 Jan 2008. DWF.

 NAME:
        UPDATE_LIBRARY

 PURPOSE:
        automatic update of IDL WWW library

 CATEGORY:
        Documentation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        UPDATE_LIBRARY,TARGETDIR,TARNAME [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        TARGETDIR --> directory where WWW library resides
           Usually a local directory, the contents of which is then
           ftp'd to the www site (default: '~/IDL/lib-tools/').

        TARNAME --> after copying all the required files, the library
           is tar'd and compressed. TARNAME is the name of the uncompressed
           file (default 'idl_lib.tar').

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIRS --> directories to search for files with SEARCHPATTERN. 
           This will only come to effect if no LISTFILE is given
           (default ['~/IDL/tools/','~/IDL/tools3d']).

        SEARCHPATTERN --> string array of filemasks which may contain 
           wildcards and determine the files to be included in the
           library (default ['*.pro', '*.doc']). This 
           parameter is also used to obtain a list of files that are
           already in the library and to determine the files to delete
           if the PACKAGE option is set.

        LISTFILE --> Name of a file that contains the names of all the
           files to be included in the library (E.g. output from the
           DISTRIBUTE routine, although this cannot be used directly).
           In this case, no search for matching files is performed.

        PACKAGE --> Normally, the individual files of the library will
           remain in TARGETDIR together with the compressed tar file.
           If the PACKAGE option is set, all individual files will be 
           deleted after creation of a new tar file. In order to retain
           information about files once included in the library, the
           file 'dirlist.old' is created before deleting the files.
           Normally this file is created at the beginning of program 
           execution.

        NO_ACTION --> DO not copy any files, create a tar file or compress
           this. This will only produce a list of all the files that
           would be included in the library together with their status 
           label ('NEW' or 'UPDATE', 'OLD' is represented byu blanks)

 OUTPUTS:
        Unless the NO_ACTION keyword is set, the TARGETDIR will contain
        a compressed tar file and unless the PACKAGE option is set, it
        will also contain a copy of all individual files that make up the 
        library.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires function STRRIGHT.

 NOTES:
        This routine uses SPAWN extensively. The spawned commands are
        UNIX specific.

        The file status 'UPDATED' is obtained by comparing the filedate
        of all files that are not 'NEW' with the date of the compressed
        tar file using the Unix find command.

 EXAMPLE:
             UPDATE_LIBRARY

        will collect all '*.pro', and '*.doc' files in the directories
        '~/IDL/tools', and '~/IDL/tools3d' , copy them into the 
        default target directory '~/IDL/lib-tools', tar them and compress
        the tar file 'idl-lib.tar'.

        In order to create a library with all '*.pro' and '*.sav' files
        of all subdirectories of '~/IDL/' in the target directory 'lib-all'
        type:

             DIRS = STR_SEP(EXPAND_PATH('+~/IDL'),':') 
             SEARCH = ['*.pro','*.sav']
             UPDATE_LIBRARY,'~/lib-all/','all_idl.tar',dirs=DIRS, $
                 searchpattern=SEARCH

        In order to pack together all the files needed to run program
        TEST.PRO, proceed as follows:

           (if you are in IDL, exit and come back in)
             JOURNAL,'test.files'
             DISTRIBUTE,'test'
             JOURNAL 

           (now edit your journal file 'test.files', keeping only the
           names of the files that belong to the test.pro package, and
           maybe add documentation and/or example files that you would
           like to include in the library and create directory ~/lib-test)

             UPDATE_LIBRARY,'~/lib-test','test.tar',listfile='test.files', $
                SEARCHPATTERN=['*.pro','*.doc','*.data'],/PACKAGE

        Note, that the filemasks in SEARCHPATTERN will be used to 
        obtain the file status, and to find the files to be deleted after
        updating the library. They are not necessary to include these
        files in the library. This is completely controlled by the entries
        of listfile.
             
        If you want to collect all '*.data' files from a list of directories
        in a library without keeping a copy of the individual files try:

             dirlist=['~/data/','~/data/aircraft/','~/data/surface/']
             UPDATE_LIBRARY,dirlist,'all_data.tar',/package, $
               searchpattern='*.data'

        VELOCITY_FIELD, U, V, X, Y [, keywords ]              
             
 INPUTS:             
        U -> The X component of the two-dimensional field.               
             U must be a two-dimensional array.             
             
        V -> The Y component of the two dimensional field.  V must have    
             the same dimensions as U.  The vector at point (i,j) has a    
             magnitude of:             
             
                       [ U(i,j)^2 + V(i,j)^2 ]^0.5             
             
             and a direction of:             
             
                       ATAN2( V(i,j), U(i,j) ).             
             
        X -> Abcissae values.  X must be a vector with a length 
             equal to the first dimension of U and V.

        Y -> Ordinate values.  Y must be a vector with a length 
             equal to the second dimension of U and V.
             
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MISSING -> Missing data high-cutoff value.  Vectors with a 
             magnitude greater than MISSING are ignored.             

        /DOTS -> If set, will place a dot at each missing data point.  
             Otherwise, will draw nothing for missing data points.  
             /DOTS only has effect if MISSING is specified.
                          
        X_STEP -> The X-extent of a cell in data coordinates.  If
             X_STEP is not specified, then a VELOCITY_FIELD will
             compute it as:
 
                X_STEP = ( Max(X) - Min(X) ) / ( N_Elements(X) - 1 )
  
             Where X is the array of abscissae as described above.

        Y_STEP -> The X-extent of a cell in data coordinates.  If
             X_STEP is not specified, then a VELOCITY_FIELD will
             compute it as:
 
                Y_STEP = ( Max(Y) - Min(Y) ) / ( N_Elements(Y) - 1 )
  
             Where X is the array of ordinates as described above.
      
        COLOR -> Specifies the color of the arrows.  Default is black.
 

        /DATELINE -> Will skip points for which an arrow cannot
             be drawn (usually across the date line).

        HSIZE -> The length of the lines used to draw the arrowhead.
             If HSIZE is positive, then the arrow head will be the
             same regardless of the length of each vector.  (Default
             size is !D.X_SIZE / 100).  If HSIZE is negative, then
             the arrowhead will be 1/HSIZEth of the total arrow
             length.
 
        LEGENDLEN -> Specify an arrow of a given length in DATA
             coordinates displayed as a legend in the calling
             routine.  Default is LONGEST. 

        LEGENDNORM -> Returns to the calling program the length of
             LEGENDLEN in NORMAL coordinates.  This is needed in
             order to plot a legend arrow in the calling program.

        LEGENDMAG -> Returns to the calling program the magnitude of
             the vector of size LEGENDLEN.  Default is LONGEST.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up all other keywords for PLOT, PLOTS, etc.

 OUTPUTS:             
        None.             
             

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        =====================
        VF_MAGNITUDE (function)

 NOTES:
        (1) You need to call MAP_SET or PLOT first, to establish the
            coordinate system.  VELOCITY_FIELD can only overplot
            vectors atop of an existing map or plot window.
           
        (2) If you are calling VELOCITY_FIELD to overplot vectors
            atop a world map, then in the calling program you must
            make sure that the longitude values contained in the X
            vector are in the range 0 - 360. 

        (3) If you do not explicitly specify Y_STEP, and your grid
            has half-size boxes at the poles, then the value of
            Y_STEP computed by VELOCITY_FIELD might be different from

 NAME:
        WRITEDATA

 PURPOSE:
        write a 2 dimensional data array and header information to a file

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        WRITEDATA,FILENAME,DATA [,HEADER,UNITS,CFACT,MCODE] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME --> the name of the output file. If the output file
            exists, the user will be prompted for a new name unless
            keyword NO_WARN is set.

        DATA --> The data array to be written.

        HEADER --> An optional string array containing variable names.
            These will be composed to a string using the DELIM delimiter.
            Note that the HEADER information can also be passed in the
            pre-formatted COMMENTS keyword parameter.

        UNITS, CFACT, MCODE --> string arrays that will be added to the
            file header concatenated with blank delimiters. These parameters
            are optional and merely there to facilitate creating chem1d
            model input files.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        TITLE --> A title string that will be the first header line.
            It is also possible to pass a string array here, although for
            more complicate file headers it is recommended to pre-format
            the file header and pass it in the COMMENTS keyword.

        DELIM --> A delimiter character for the HEADER (variable name)
            items. Default is a blank ' '.

        COMMENTS --> A string array containing all the lines of the file
            header. Note that COMMENTS overrules the input of HEADER, UNITS,
            CFACT, and MCODE as well as TITLE.

        /NO_WARN --> Suppress warning message and user prompt for a new
            filename if the file already exists.

 OUTPUTS:
        A file containing a file header and the data array written
        line by line.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        DATA = findgen(3,10)
        HEADER = ['A','B','C']
        writedata,'test.out',DATA,HEADER,TITLE='test file',DELIM=';'

        This will create a file like:
            test file
            A;B;C
                  0.00000      1.00000      2.00000
                  3.00000      4.00000      5.00000
            ...

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 25 Nov 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 05 Apr 1999: - now uses formatted write statement
                 (looks like a bug in IDL for windows: sometimes no space
                  is printed between numbers if you simply print,data)

 PURPOSE:
        Write a binary data file with size information and
        variable names and units

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        WRITE_BDT0001,filename,data,vardesc[,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file to write or a file mask
            which will be used in the PICKFILE dialog. If the 
            filemask is a named variable, it will return the 
            actual filename.

        DATA -> a 2D data array with dimensions LINES,VARIABLES

        VARDESC -> A variable descriptor structure array (see 
            GTE_VARDESC). This array must contain one structure 
            for each variable and the structure must have the 
            tags NAME and UNIT. Alternatively, you can use the
            NAMES and UNITS keywords to pass string arrays.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NAMES -> A string array containing variable names. This 
            will only be used if no VARDESC structure array is 
            given.
 
        UNITS -> A string array with physical units for each 
            variable. (see NAMES)

        COMMENTS -> A string (or string array) with comment lines.
            Only the first 80 characters of each line will be stored.

        SELECTION -> An index array to select only a subset of
            variables from the data set. Indices are truncated 
            to lie in the range 0..n_elements(names), which can
            lead to multiple output of the same variable!

        _EXTRA keywords are passed on to OPEN_FILE

        Flags to determine the data type:
        Default is to store the data in its current type. Use the
        TYPE keyword to convert it to any other (numeric) type
        or use one of the following keywords. The type information
        is saved in the file, so READ_BDT0001 can automatically 
        read the data regardless of the format.

        /BYTE -> convert data to byte format
        /INT -> convert data to (2 byte) integer format
        /LONG -> convert data to (4 byte) integer format
        /FLOAT -> convert data to (4 byte) real format
        /DOUBLE -> convert data to (8 byte) double prec. real format
        /COMPLEX -> convert data to (8 byte) complex
        /DCOMPLEX -> convert data to (16 byte) double complex

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses OPEN_FILE, STR2BYTE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        Format specification:

 NAME:
       XCOLORS

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this routine is to interactively change color tables
       in a manner similar to XLOADCT. No common blocks are used so
       multiple copies of XCOLORS can be on the display at the same
       time (if each has a different TITLE). XCOLORS has the ability
       to notify a widget event handler, an object method, or an IDL
       procedure if and when a new color table has been loaded. The
       event handler, object method, or IDL procedure is then responsibe
       for updating the program's display on 16- or 24-bit display systems.

 CATEGORY:
       Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       XCOLORS

 INPUTS:
       None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       BLOCK: If this keyword is set, the program will try to block the
          IDL command line. Note that this is only possible if no other
          widget program is currently blocking the IDL command line. It
          is much more reliable to make XCOLORS a modal widget (see the MODAL
          keyword), although this can generally only be done when XCOLORS
          is called from another widget program.

       BOTTOM: The lowest color index of the colors to be changed.

       COLORINFO: This output keyword will return either a pointer to
          a color information structure (if the program is called in
          a non-modal fashion) or a color information structure (if the program
          is called in modal or blocking fashion). The color information
          structure is an anonymous structure defined like this:

             struct = { R: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current R color vector.
                        G: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current G color vector.
                        B: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current B color vector.
                        NAME: "", $                 ; The name of the current color table.
                        INDEX: 0 }                  ; The index number of the current color table.

          If a pointer to the structure is obtained, you will be responsible
          for freeing it to prevent memory leakage:

             XColors, ColorInfo=colorInfoPtr
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", (*colorInfoPtr).Name
             Ptr_Free, colorInfoPtr

          Note that that Name field will be "Unknown" and the Index field will
          be -1 until a color table is actually selected by the user. You are
          responsible for checking this value before you use it.

          When called in modal or blocking fashion, you don't have to worry about freeing
          the pointer, since no pointer is involved:

             XColors, /Block, ColorInfo=colorInfoData
             Help, colorInfoData, /Structure
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", colorInfoData.Name

       DATA: This keyword can be set to any valid IDL variable. If
          the variable is defined, the specified object method or notify
          procedure will be passed this variable via a DATA keyword. This
          keyword is defined primarily so that Notify Procedures are compatible
          with the XLOADCT way of passing data. It is not strictly required,
          since the _EXTRA keyword inheritance mechanism will allow passing
          of *any* keyword parameter defined for the object or procedure that is
          to be notified.

       DRAG: Set this keyword if you want colors loaded as you drag
          the sliders. Default is to update colors only when you release
          the sliders.

       _EXTRA: This keyword inheritance mechanism will pick up and
          pass along to any method or procedure to be notified and keywords
          that are defined for that procedure. Note that you should be sure
          that keywords are spelled correctly. Any mis-spelled keyword will
          be ignored.

       FILE: A string variable pointing to a file that holds the
          color tables to load. The normal colors1.tbl file is used by default.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group
          leader is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       INDEX: The index of the color table to start up. If provided, a color
           table of this index number is loaded prior to display. Otherwise,
           the current color table is used. Set this keyword if you wish
           to have the index number of the event structure correct when
           the user CANCELs out of the progam.

       MODAL: Set this keyword (along with the GROUP_LEADER keyword) to
          make the XCOLORS dialog a modal widget dialog. Note that NO
          other events can occur until the XCOLORS program is destroyed
          when in modal mode.

       NCOLORS: This is the number of colors to load when a color table
          is selected.

       NOSLIDERS: If this keyword is set, the color stretch and color gamma
          sliders are not displayed. This would be appropriate, for example,
          for programs that just load pre-defined color tables.

       NOTIFYID: A 2-column by n-row array that contains the IDs of widgets
          that should be notified when XCOLORS loads a color table. The first
          column of the array is the widgets that should be notified. The
          second column contains IDs of widgets that are at the top of the
          hierarchy in which the corresponding widgets in the first column
          are located. (The purpose of the top widget IDs is to make it
          possible for the widget in the first column to get the "info"
          structure of the widget program.) An XCOLORS_LOAD event will be
          sent to the widget identified in the first column. The event
          structure is defined like this:

          event = {XCOLORS_LOAD, ID:0L, TOP:0L, HANDLER:0L, $
             R:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), G:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), $
             B:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), INDEX:0, NAME:""}

          The ID field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[0, n] and the TOP
          field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[1, n]. The R, G, and B
          fields will have the current color table vectors, obtained by
          exectuing the command TVLCT, r, g, b, /Get. The INDEX field will
          have the index number of the just-loaded color table. The name
          field will have the name of the currently loaded color table.

          Note that XCOLORS can't initially tell *which* color table is
          loaded, since it just uses whatever colors are available when it
          is called. Thus, it stores a -1 in the INDEX field to indicate
          this "default" value. Programs that rely on the INDEX field of
          the event structure should normally do nothing if the value is
          set to -1. This value is also set to -1 if the user hits the
          CANCEL button. (Note the NAME field will initially be "Unknown").

          Typically the XCOLORS button will be defined like this:

             xcolorsID = Widget_Button(parentID, Value='Load New Color Table...', $
                Event_Pro='Program_Change_Colors_Event')

          The event handler will be written something like this:

             PRO Program_Change_Colors_Event, event

                ; Handles color table loading events. Allows colors be to changed.

             Widget_Control, event.top, Get_UValue=info, /No_Copy
             thisEvent = Tag_Names(event, /Structure_Name)
             CASE thisEvent OF

                'WIDGET_BUTTON': BEGIN

                     ; Color table tool.

                   XColors, NColors=info.ncolors, Bottom=info.bottom, $
                      Group_Leader=event.top, NotifyID=[event.id, event.top]
                   ENDCASE

                'XCOLORS_LOAD': BEGIN

                     ; Update the display for 24-bit displays.

                    ...Whatever display commands are required go here. For example...

                    TV, info.image

                 ENDIF
                 ENDCASE

              ENDCASE

              Widget_Control, event.top, Set_UValue=info, /No_Copy
              END

       NOTIFYOBJ: A vector of structures (or a single structure), with
          each element of the vector defined as follows:

             struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, object:Obj_New(), method:''}

          where the Object field is an object reference, and the Method field
          is the name of the object method that should be called when XCOLORS
          loads its color tables.

             ainfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, a, 'Draw'}
             binfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, b, 'Display'}
             XColors, NotifyObj=[ainfo, binfo]

          Note that the XColors program must be compiled before these structures
          are used. Alternatively, you can put this program, named
          "xcolors_notifyobj__define.pro" (*three* underscore characters in this
          name!) in your PATH:

             PRO XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ__DEFINE
              struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, OBJECT:Obj_New(), METHOD:''}
             END

          Or, you can simply define this structure as it is shown here in your code.

          "Extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          the object method, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your methods. If you expect such keywords, your methods should be defined
          with an _Extra keyword.

       NOTIFYPRO: The name of a procedure to notify or call when the color
          tables are loaded. If the DATA keyword is also defined, it will
          be passed to this program via an DATA keyword. But note that *any*
          keyword appropriate for the procedure can be used in the call to
          XCOLORS. For example, here is a procedure that re-displays and image
          in the current graphics window:

             PRO REFRESH_IMAGE, Image=image, _Extra=extra, WID=wid
             IF N_Elements(wid) NE 0 THEN WSet, wid
             TVIMAGE, image, _Extra=extra
             END

          This program can be invoked with this series of commands:

             IDL> Window, /Free
             IDL> TVImage, image, Position=[0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.8]
             IDL> XColors, NotifyPro='Refresh_Image', Image=image, WID=!D.Window

          Note that "extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          your procedure, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your procedure. If you expect such keywords, your procedure should
          be defined with an _Extra keyword as illustrated above.

       TITLE: This is the window title. It is "Load Color Tables" by
          default. The program is registered with the name 'XCOLORS:' plus
          the TITLE string. The "register name" is checked before the widgets
          are defined. If a program with that name has already been registered
          you cannot register another with that name. This means that you can
          have several versions of XCOLORS open simultaneously as long as each
          has a unique title or name. For example, like this:

            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=0, Title='First 100 Colors'
            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=100, Title='Second 100 Colors'

       XOFFSET: This is the X offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

       YOFFSET: This is the Y offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       Colors are changed. Events are sent to widgets if the NOTIFYID
       keyword is used. Object methods are called if the NOTIFYOBJ keyword
       is used. This program is a non-blocking widget.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To load a color table into 100 colors, starting at color index
       50 and send an event to the widget identified at info.drawID
       in the widget heirarchy of the top-level base event.top, type:

       XCOLORS, NCOLORS=100, BOTTOM=50, NOTIFYID=[info.drawID, event.top]

 NAME:
        YBOXPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        Produce a box and whisker plot of a data vector
        categories displayed on the Y axis as opposed to boxplot

 CATEGORY:
        Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        YBOXPLOT, DATA [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> the data vector

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        GROUP -> array of the same dimension as DATA which contains
             grouping information. One box is plotted for each group.
             If MINGROUP or MAXGROUP are given, boxes and whiskers are
             only plotted for group values within this range.
             GROUP may not contain more than 28 different values.
             Group can also be a string array. In this case MINGROUP
             and MAXGROUP make no sense of course.

        MINGROUP -> the minimum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        MAXGROUP -> the maximum group value for which a box shall be
             plotted

        LABEL -> string array containing labels for *different* groups.
             NOTE: The user must take care that one label is passed for
             each group to be plotted. If label is not specified, the
             group values will be used as axis labels

        COLOR -> plotting color for axis (default : 1, i.e. black in MYCT
             color scheme). Will also be used as default for BOXCOLOR.

        BOXCOLOR -> color of the boxes (frames). Default is the COLOR
             value, i.e. 1 if not specified. This color will also be used as
             default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR. If you want boxes that 
             are only filled but have no frame, you must specify BOXCOLOR=-1.
             In this case the default for MEDIANCOLOR and MEANCOLOR will
             be the COLOR value.

        BOXWIDTH -> relative width of boxes (default: 0.8).

        BOXPOSITION -> relative position of box on x axis (default: 0.).
             This parameter can be used together with the OVERPLOT keyword
             to plot multiple groups of boxes in one graph.

        MEDIANCOLOR -> a color value for the median bar
             (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        MEANSYMBOL -> symbol to be used for mean values. If no symbol
             is given, no mean values will be drawn.

        MEANCOLOR -> color for mean symbols (default: value of BOXCOLOR)

        FILLCOLOR -> a value or an array containing the colorindex for all
             boxes or each box, respectively. If a single value is given,
             *all* boxes will be filled with this color. If an array is 
             passed that has less elements than there are groups to plot, 
             the remaining colors will be filled with 15 (grey in MYCT 
             standard-scheme). If no FILLCOLOR is specified, the boxes will 
             be empty.

        MISSING -> a value that represents missing data. If given, any data
             with a value of missing will be filtered out before plotting.

        PRINTN -> print number of elements on top of each box/whisker

        CHARSIZE -> character size of the PRINTN labels (default: 0.8)

        /OVERPLOT -> do not draw a new coordinate system but overlay new
             data. For 2 sets of data you should use BOXWIDTH=0.4 and
             BOXPOSITION=-0.25 and 0.25, respectively.

        ORIENTATION -> orientation for axis labels (see XYOUTS procedure)

        /IS_PERCENTILE -> data are already processed percentiles. In this
             case data must be an array with dimensions 5,N. The GROUP keyword
             is ignored, and each set of the N percentiles will be treated as
             one group.

        PERCVAL -> float array with 5 elements denoting the percentile
             values (default: 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95)

        Further keywords are passed to the PLOT routine and can be used
        to determine the appearance of the plot (e.g. XTITLE,YTITLE,
        YSTYLE,YRANGE,/YLOG,COLOR,THICK)

 OUTPUTS:
        None

             ; to the x and y axis.  The number of valid observations 
             ; is printed on top of each box. The boxes are reduced 
             ; in size.

 PURPOSE:
        Query user for decisions with only two possible answers.

 CATEGORY:
        General

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        ANSWER = YESNO( QUESTION [,DEFAULT=DEFAULT ,/STRING ] )

 INPUTS:
        QUESTION -> A string containing the query. The following
            will automatically be added to QUESTION: ' (Y/N) [x] : '
            where x is replaced by the default selection.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DEFAULT -> either 0 (for 'NO') or 1 (for 'YES'). Default is 0.

        /QUIT_OPTION -> if set, the user can quit with 'Q'. This
            option is appended to the (Y/N) string. YesNo returns
            -1 if quit was selected.

        /STRING -> set this keyword to return a 'Y' or 'N' instead
            of the numerical values 0 or 1.

 OUTPUTS:
        ANSWER -> An integer 0 or 1 that can be used in boolean 
            expressions, or a 1 character string if /STRING is set. 
            -1 is returned if /QUIT was allowed and used.

 NAME:
        ZMID  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Given a vector of altitudes at vertical edges of a model grid
        computes the altitudes at the grid centers.

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = ZMID( EDGE )

 INPUTS:
        EDGE -> Vector of altitude edges that defines the grid.  
             EDGE will be sorted in ascending order.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Altitudes at grid centers [m, km, etc]

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        The relationship between altitude centers and edges is:

              ZMID[N] = ( ZEDGE[N] + ZEDGE[N+1] ) / 2.0
   
 EXAMPLE:
        PRINT, ZMID( [ 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 ] )
           1.00000  3.00000  5.00000  7.00000

             ; Given the altitude at grid edges at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 km

 NAME:
        ZSTAR  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Computes pressure-altitudes from pressures.

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = ZSTAR( PRESS )

 INPUTS:
        PRESS -> The input pressure value, in [hPa].
             PRESS can be either a scalar or a vector.
             
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Computed pressure altitude(s) [km]

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        Pressure-altitude is defined as:

            Z* = 16 * log10[ 1000 / P(mb) ]

        which, by the Laws of Logarithms, is equivalent to

            Z* = 48 - ( 16 * log10[ P(mb) ] ).

 EXAMPLE:
        PRINT, ZSTAR( [ 900, 700, 500 ] )
          0.732121  2.47843  4.81648
