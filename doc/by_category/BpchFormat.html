 NAME:
        BPCH2ASCII

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch file v. 2.0 
        format to a simple ASCII file format
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2ASCII, INFILE, OUTFILE [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the ASCII file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2ASCII will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII format to OUTFILE.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, then BPCH2ASCII will also echo the
             header lines for each data block to the screen.

        FORMAT -> String containing the numeric format for
             for the data values.  Default is '(7(e13.6,1x))'

 OUTPUTS:
         None

 SUBROUTINES:
         External Subroutines Required:
         =============================================
         CTM_GET_DATA         TAU2YYMMDD    (function)
         GETMODELANDGRIDINFO  REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
         UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2ASCII assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same grid.  This will be true for output
            files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (2) BPCH2ASCII will write a separate ASCII file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (3) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may be either in uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) The format of the ASCII file is:

               Data block #1 header line
               Data block #1 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
               Data block #2 header line
               Data block #2 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
                ...

             The header line will contain the units and size of
             each data block.

        (5) The data is written to the ASCII file in column-major 
            order (i.e. the same way as in FORTRAN), so you can read 
            the data into FORTRAN w/ the following code:

                  READ( IUNIT, '(a)' ) HEADER
                  READ( IUNIT, '(1p,7(e13.6,1x))' )
            &       ((DATA(I,J), I=1,IMX), J=1,JMX)

            where IMX and JMX are the dimensions of the data block.       
     

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2ASCII, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii'
        
             ; Read data from binary punch file 'myfile.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII file 'myfile.bpch.ascii'.

 NAME:
        BPCH2COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in a
        COARDS-compliant netCDF (network Common Data Format) file.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2COARDS, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If INFILE
             is not passed, the user will be prompted to supply a 
             file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% (or %date%)
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2COARDS will write a separate
             netCDF file for each unique YYYYMMDD value contained
             within the *.bpch file.  If OUTFILE is not specified,
             BPCH2COARDS will use the default file name 
             "coards.%DATE%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories from the bpch file
             to save to netCDF format.  If omitted, BPCH2COARDS will 
             save all diagnostic categories.  
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the name of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.  Useful
             for debugging purposes.

        /NC4 -> Write a netCDF4 file instead of netCDF3. Default is
             NetCDF3. NetCDF4 support requires IDL 8.0 or later. 

        COMPRESS -> Integer 0-9 specifies amount of compression in
             netCDF4 files. Default is 2, with very little benefit
             for higher compression.

        /PCOORD -> Use mean pressure as the vertical coordinate rather
             sigma or eta

        /ALTCOORD -> Use mean altitude as the vertical coordinate
             rather than sigma or eta

        /TROPONLY -> Write only tropospheric layers

        /ONEFILE -> Write all data to one netCDF output file.
              Default is one file per calendar day.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2COARDS assumes that each data block in the *.bpch
            file is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2COARDS assumes that the number type of each data 
            block in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2COARDS assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2COARDS will write a separate COARDS-compliant netCDF
            file corresponding to each unique YYYYMMDD date.  This 
            prevents the files from becoming too large to be read
            with IDL.

        (5) BPCH2COARDS will replace the %DATE% (or %date%) token with
            the current YYYYMMDD value.  Therefore, it is recommended
            to insert this token into the string passed via OUTFILE.

        (6) BPCH2COARDS will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the eta or sigma centers will also be written to the
            file.  Time will be written as TAU values (i.e. hours
            since 00:00 GMT on 01-Jan-1985.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2COARDS, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more COARDS-compliant netCDF files adhering
            ; to the filename convention "myfile.YYYYMMDD.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2GMI

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.  The data
        will be shifted so that the first longitude is 0 degrees
        (i.e. the prime meridian) in order to conform with the
        GMI (Global Model Initiative) model grid definition.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2GMI, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

             array of names which will restrict the data block 
             selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
             within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for netCDF routines

 OUTPUTS:

            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2GMI assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2GMI assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2GMI will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2GMI will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2GMI will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers will also be written to the file.  
            Date and time are stored as global attributes.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2GMI, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2HDF

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in HDF-SD 
        (Hierarchical Data Format, Scientific Dataset) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2HDF, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the HDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2HDF will write a separate
             HDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2hdf_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in HDF format to OUTFILE.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for HDF_SETSD

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =========================================
        CTM_GET_DATA    TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE        REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        HDF_SETSD       GETMODELANDGRIDINFO

 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the HDF-SD routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2HDF assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt).  

        (2) BPCH2HDF assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will be true
            for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (3) BPCH2HDF will write a separate HDF file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  These tokens may be in either
            uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will also write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes, sigma coordinates (for 3-D data blocks only!)
            to the HDF file.

        (5) BPCH2HDF will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers and sigma edges will also be written 
            to the file.

 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2HDF, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to
            ; one or more HDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.hdf"

 NAME:
        BPCH2NC

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2NC, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2N_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2N_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2N_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2NC assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2NC assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2NC assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2NC will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2NC will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  

        (7) For pure-sigma grids (e.g. GEOS-1, GEOS-STRAT, GEOS-3),
            BPCH2NC will write the following additional variables to 
            the netCDF file:

            (1) SIGE : Sigma coordinate at level edges
            (2) SIGC : Sigma coordinate at level centers

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:

                Pe(L) = Ptop + [ SIGE(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = Ptop + [ SIGC(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            %%%%% NOTE: This is mostly obsolete, as most met fields
            %%%%% that are used to drive CTM's are now placed onto
            %%%%% hybrid grids.

        (8) For hybrid grids (e.g. GEOS-4, GEOS-5, MERRA), the following
            dditional variables will be written to the netCDF file:

            (1) ETAE : Eta coordinate on level edges
            (2) ETAC : Eta coordinate on level centers
            (3) Ap   : Hybrid grid "A" parameter
            (4) Bp   : Hybrid grid "B" parameter

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:
 
                Pe(L) = Ap(L) + ( Bp(L) * Psurface )

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = ( Pe(L) + Pe(L+1) ) * 0.5

            The hybrid ETA coordinates (similar to sigma) at the 
            level edges and centers are, correspondingly:

                ETAE(L) = ( Pe(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )
                ETAC(L) = ( Pc(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )

            %%%%% NOTE: The ETAe and ETAc values are only approximate
            %%%%% and are computed with a surface pressure of 1013.25
            %%%%% hPa.  For your scientific analysis, you should compute
            %%%%% the pressures at level edges from Ap, Bp, and a 
            %%%%% spatially-varying surface pressure field (e.g. saved
            %%%%% out from GEOS-Chem or another model).
          
        (7) The date and time of the data are stored in the netCDF 
            file as global attributes.

        (8) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2NC, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

             FILENAME is omitted or contains a wild card character,
             the user will be prompted to pick a file via a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the output ASCII punch
             file.  Default is 'ASCIIfile.pch' 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII punch format
              to OUTFILE.

         /EXTRA_SPACE -> If set, will put an extra space between
             the numbers in the ASCII punch file.  This might 
             be necessary when using MATLAB or S-PLUS to read
             in the ASCII punch file.

 OUTPUTS:
         Writes data to ASCII punch file format

 SUBROUTINES:
         CTM_GET_DATA 

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
         Some limitations:
         (1) Works only for global lon-lat diagnostics.           
         (2) The top header line might be inaccurate (but nobody
             really reads that anyway, so forget it for now...)

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2PCH, '~/bmy/ctm.bpch', '~/bmy/ctm.pch'
        
             ; Reads data from binary punch file '~/bmy/ctm.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII punch file '~/bmy/ctm.pch'.

 NAME:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN

 PURPOSE:
        Creates monthly means from GEOS-Chem output saved at less
        than monthly intervals.  Ideal for working with output of 
        high-resolution model output, especially if your queuing
        system time limits do not permit a 1-month simulation to be
        completed in a single run stage.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FILES -> A vector containing the pathnames of the files from
             which you would like to create monthly mean output.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file (bpch format) that will
             contain the monthly mean output.  The default is 
             "bpch_monthly_mean_output.bpch".

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required
        ================================

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires other routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        Assumes that each of the files passed via the FILES argument
        contains an identical sequence of diagnostic data blocks.
        This will normally be the case for GEOS-Chem simulations that 
        have to be separated into several run stages for the queue
        system.

        Error checking is minimal, we will fix this later.  This
        routine in intended for use with files that are created from
        individual stages of a long GEOS-Chem simulation.  As such,
        we can usually assume that all files will have the same
        sequence of data blocks, and that all data blocks will be on
        the same grid.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILES = [ 'ctm.bpch.2011010100', 'ctm.bpch.2011011500' ]
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES, OUTFILENAME = 'monthly_mean.bpch'

             ; Creates monthly-mean output from two GEOS-Chem bpch
             ; files that contain 15-day averaged data.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        BPCH_SEP

 PURPOSE:
        Separates data from one binary punch file into another binary 
        punch file by time (TAU0), tracer, or location indices.  Useful 
        for making smaller bpch files so that we don't run out of IDL 
        memory when reading/processing them.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:p
        BPCH_SEP, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> A path name or file mask (with wildcards) 
             which indicates the names of the individual files
             to be linked together in a single bpch file.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the bpch file that will contain data
             from the individual bpch files specified by INFILES.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories for which to 
             save out to OUTFILE  Default is to save all diagnostic
             categories to OUTFILE.

        TAU0 -> Time index (hours from 1 Jan 1985) denoting the
             data blocks to be saved from INFILE to OUTFILE.  You
             can use NYMD2TAU to compute this from a YYYYMMDD date.

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which to save to OUTFILE.  
             Default is to save all tracers.

        II, JJ, LL -> Longitude, latitude, altitude index arrays used
             to cut down the data block to less than global size. Use
             IDL notation, meaning first element is 0.

        GLOBALCOORDS ->  When the data entries in the bpch file 
             contain only part of the global CTM grid (e.g. ND48,
             ND49, ND50, ND51) this indicates 
             that II, JJ, LL indices should be
             interpreted as global CTM indices, rather than relative
             to the regional subset grid. 

         EXCLUDE -> Reverses the selection criteria, so that the
         designated DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER are EXCLUDED from the
         output file. Everything else is included. In order to be
         excluded, a datablock must match all specified keywords:
         DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER. 


 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================================
        CTM_DIAGINFO    LITTLE_ENDIAN (function)
        OPEN_FILE       UNDEFINE 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Assumes that II, JJ, LL contain consecutive indices in
            longitude, latitude, and altitude, respectively.

        (2) Also assumes that II, JJ, LL are in IDL notation
            (i.e. starting from zero).  This is so that you can
            pass the output from the WHERE command to BPCH_SEP.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', tau0=140256D

             ; Pulls out data blocks for TAU0=140256 (1/1/2001) from
             ; "ctm.bpch.big" and saves them in "ctm.bpch.small"


        (2) 
        INTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        INGRID = CTM_GRID( INTYPE )
  
        INDX = WHERE( INGRID.XMID ge -60 AND INGRID.XMID le 60 )
        INDY = WHERE( INGRID.YMID ge   0 AND INGRID.YMID le 60 )
         
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', II=INDX, JJ=INDY

             ; Pulls out all data blocks for the geographical area
             ; from 60W - 60E longitude and 0-60N latitude.

        A binary punch file with the selected data records will be
        created.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================================
        CHKSTRU      (function)   CTM_DIAGINFO
        CTM_GET_DATA (function)   DATATYPE     (function)   
        OPEN_FILE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        This routine forces reading of all selected data records via
        CTM_GET_DATA.  This may take a while for huge ASCII punch files.

 EXAMPLE:
        gamap [,options]  ; call gamap to read records from a file
        @gamap_cmn        ; get global datainfo structure
        d = *pglobalDataInfo 
        ind = where(d.tracer eq 2)  ; select all Ox records
        ctm_writebpch,d[ind],filename='oxconc.bpch'

 NAME:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 PURPOSE:
        Convert bpch files (matching a mask) to netCDF format. 
        The routine can work recursively : files in subdirectories
        are also searched for.
        
        This is a convenient generic wrapper for GAMAP routine
        Bpch2coards.pro, to work on several files and directories at
        once.
        
        When working recursively, the directory tree in the input
        directory is recreated as needed in the output directory.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 INPUTS:
        none

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MASK -> string, default is '*', that is all files

        INPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory of files to convert, if
             not specified, a dialog window pops up

        OUTPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory destination for netCDF
             files, if not specified, a dialog window pops up.

        RECURSION -> to search subdirectories. Default is 0
             (OFF). Set to 1 to turn it on.

        TOKEN -> set if you want to replace 'bpch' with 'nc' in all
             part of the full name. Default is to have extension
            ".nc" added to file name only.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        To work recursively on the directories, I use FILE_SEARCH
        with 2 arguments. This is not possible with MFINDFILE, and
        works only with IDL 5.5 and above. 

 EXAMPLES:

        indir  = '/as/data/geos/GEOS_1x1/EDGAR_200607/'         
        outdir = '/home/phs/data/EDGAR_200607/nc/'             
        mask   = '*1x1'
