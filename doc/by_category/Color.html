 NAME:		
        CINDEX

 PURPOSE:	
        This is a program for viewing the current colors in the 
	 colortable with their index numbers overlayed on each color.
        
	 CINDEX Draws a NROW x NCOL set of small rectangles, each of 
        which displays one of the colors in the color table.  It also
        writes the color index number on top of each rectangle.

 CATEGORY:	
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:	
        CINDEX

 INPUTS:	
        None
	
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NCOL -> Specify the number of columns in the plot. 
             Default is 16.

        NROW -> Specify the number of columns in the plot.  If not 
             specified, then CINDEX will compute the minimum number
             of rows that are needed to display all of the colors,
             given the setting of NCOL.

        TITLE -> Specify the title for the plot window.

        /ALL -> Set this switch to plot all 256 colors on a 16x16 grid.
             Colors that are not defined will be rendered as white.

 OUTPUTS:	
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        MYCT, /WhGrYlRd
        CINDEX
 
             ; Displays the colors of the MYCT color table
             ; WHITE-GREEN-YELLOW-RED (spectral).  The drawing
             ; colors and all 20 colors of this table are shown.

        (2)
        MYCT, /WhGrYlRd
        CINDEX, /ALL
 
             ; Same as above, but plots the colors on a 
             ; 16 x 16 grid.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:  
        INITIAL REVISION: David Fanning, RSI, May 1995
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Added NCOL, ROW, TITLE, ALL keywords to
                            allow the user to specify these settings
                            instead of having these be hardwired.
        bmy, 21 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Now use NAME and INDEX tags from !MYCT 
                            to define the default title string.

 NAME:
        COLORBAR

 PURPOSE:
        Draw a colorbar (legend) with labels

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COLORBAR [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ANNOTATION -> Array with string label values.  If specified,
             ANNOTATION will override the default label values, and 
             will also override the LABEL keyword.

        BOTOUTOFRANGE, TOPOUTOFRANGE -> a color index value for data
             that falls below (or above) the normal plot range. If 
             given, an extra box will be drawn to the left (or right) 
             of the colorbar, and the colorbar will shrink in size.  
             A default label '<' (or '>') will be placed below.  
             NOTE: these options are only available for horizontal 
             colorbars.

        BOR_LABEL, TOR_LABEL -> label values for BOTOUTOFRANGE and 
             TOPOUTOFRANGE that replace the defaults.

        BOTTOM -> First color index to use.  Default is !MYCT.BOTTOM.
             NOTE: In practice you shouldn't have to specify BOTTOM,
             as the value from !MYCT.BOTTOM will reflect the settings
             of the current colortable.

        C_COLORS -> Array of color indices for "discrete" color bars
             e.g. in filled contour plots. You must also use the 
             C_LEVELS keyword, otherwise there will most likely be
             a mismatch between your plot colors and your colorbar 
             colors. COLORBAR normally limits the number of labels
             it prints to 10. Use the SKIP keyword to force a different
             behaviour. If C_COLORS is not undefined it overrides the
             settings from NCOLORS, and BOTTOM.

        C_LEVELS -> Array with label values for "discrete" colorbars.
             Use the LABEL or ANNOTATION keyword for continuous
             colorbars.  C_LEVELS must have the same number of elements 
             as C_COLORS and assigns one label to each color change 
             (LABEL distributes the labels evenly). Use the SKIP
             keyword to skip labels.  As default, COLORBAR limits the 
             number of labels printed to 10.

        AUTOSCALELEVELS -> Set this switch to automatically scale
             labels (specified by C_LEVELS, LABEL, MAX, or MIN) 
             by powers of 10. This reduces the length of each tick label
             and helps prevent overlapping numbers in the colorbar.  

        CHARSIZE -> Specifies the character size for colorbar labels.
             Default is !P.CHARSIZE.

        COLOR -> The drawing color for boxes and labels.  
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels to put on the colorbar.
             Note that this keyword is overwritten by LABEL.
             The labels will be equally spaced and the /LOG option
             will be honored.

        FLAGVAL -> If set, will place a tick mark with label at a
             user-defined value.  You can use this to denote where
             0 or 1 falls w/in a color range, for example.

        FORMAT -> Output format of the labels.  Default is determined
             according to the range given in min and max.  Label 
             strings will be trimmed, so you can safely specify 
             '(f14.2)' for example.

        LABEL -> Array containing label values (must be numeric).
             Normally, it is easier to generate labels with the 
             DIVISIONS options, but this allows tighter control 
             (e.g. 1,2,5,10,20 labels on logarithmic scales).
             Default (if no DIVISIONS are given): MIN and MAX.
             NOTE: ANNOTATION will 

        /LOG -> Set this switch to invoke logarithmic spacing of 
             labels.  The colors are *always* linearily distributed.

        MAX -> Maximum value to plot.  Default is NCOLORS.

        MIN -> Minimum value to plot.  Default is BOTTOM.

        /NOGAP -> if 0 then there is a gap b/w the triangle or
             rectangle OutOfRange boxes and the bar, else no
             gap. Defalut is to have a gap. If /TRIANGLE and no
             OutOfRange boxes are set then default is No Gap.

        NCOLORS -> Number of colors to use in the colorbar.  Default 
             is !MYCT.NCOLORS.  NOTE: In practice you shouldn't have 
             to specify NCOLORS, as the value from !MYCT.NCOLORS will 
             reflect the settings of the current colortable.

        ORIENTATION -> Specifies the orientation of the colorbar
             labels.  This keyword has the same behavior as the 
             ORIENTATION option in XYOUTS (i.e. ORIENTATION=0 means
             normal "left-right" text, ORIENTATION=-90 means "top-
             bottom" text, etc.)

        POSITION -> A position value or 4-element vector. If POSITION
             contains only one element, it will be centered at the
             bottom or right side of the page and extend over 60% of
             the total plotting area.

        SCIENTIFIC -> If set, will call STRSCI to put the colorbar
             labels in scientific notation format (e.g. in the form
             A x 10^B).  STRSCI will use the format string specified 
             in the FORMAT keyword.

        SKIP -> Print only every Nth discrete label.  The default is 
             computed such that COLORBAR will print no more than 10 
             labels.

        TITLE -> A title string for the colorbar.  (This works similarly 
             to the XTITLE or YTITLE options to the PLOT command.)

        TICKLEN -> A number between 0 and 1 which defines the length
             of the tick marks as a fraction of the size of the plot
             box.  Default is 0.25.

        /TRIANGLE -> to plot triangles at the end of the color bar. If 
             OutOfRange boxes are requested, then the triangles
             replace the rectangle.

        UNIT -> A unit string that will be added to the right of the
             labels.  If /VERTICAL is set, then the unit string will
             be placed at the top of the labels.

        UPOS -> Specifies the position (relative to the size of the 
             colorbar) where the unit string will be placed.  The
             default is 1.15.  To print the unit string closer to the
             end of the colorbar, reduce this value until the desired
             appearance is obtained.

        /VERTICAL -> Set this keyword to produce a vertical colorbar
             (default is horizontal).  Note that out-of-range boxes are
             only implemented for horizontal color bars.  

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================
        STRSCI (function)  TRIANGLE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Assumes that we are using a MYCT-defined colortable.

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine was designed after David Fanning's colorbar
            routine and adapted to our needs.  Some of the postscript
            handling of DF was removed, positioning is a little easier 
            but maybe a little less flexible; out-of-range boxes have 
            been added.

        (2) The !MYCT system variable contains the properties of the
            current MYCT-defined colortable.  You normally should not
            have to explicity pass BOTTOM or NCOLORS, as these
            keywords will be initialized from the values from !MYCT.

 EXAMPLES:
        COLORBAR, MIN=MIN( DATA, MAX=M ), MAX=M

            ; Draw a horizontal colorbar with all available colors
            ; Default placement is at the bottom of the page.
            ; will be placed at the bottom of the page

        COLORBAR, MIN=0.1, MAX=10, /LOG, UNIT='[ppt]', $
            LABELS=[0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ], 
            POSITION=[0.3. 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]
 
            ; Draw another colorbar above the first one, 
            ; use logarithmic scale

        COLORBAR, MIN=0.1, MAX=10, /LOG, UNIT='[ppt]', $
            LABELS=[0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ], 
            POSITION=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], /VERTICAL

            ; Draw vertical colorbar closer to the left edge of 
            ; the plot.  Otherwise options are the same as in the 
            ; previous example.

        COLORBAR, MIN=0, MAX=100, $
            DIVISIONS=5, TOPOUTOFRANGE=!MYCT.WHITE

            ; Draw horizontal colorbar with out-of-range box
            ; (colored white) to the right of the max value.

        COLORBAR, MIN=0, MAX=100, $
            DIVISIONS=5, TOPOUTOFRANGE=!MYCT.WHITE, $
            ANNOTATION=[ '0', '2,500', '5,000', '7,500', '10,000' ]

            ; Same example as above, but this time we use the
            ; ANNOTATION keyword to override the default labels
            ; with string labels.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

        (up to a user-defined limit) such that tickmarks are placed 
        in between colors.

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Result = COLORBAR_NDIV( NCOLORS [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        NCOLORS -> (OPTIONAL) Specifies the number of colors 
             in the color table.  Default is !MYCT.NCOLORS.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MAXDIV -> Specifies the maximum number of divisions 
             for the colorbar.  Default is 6.

        TVMAP, ..., DIVISONS=DIV, ...
             
             ; Computes the number of color bar divisions for
             ; a colortable with 20 colors.  DIV will not exceed
             ; the value of MAXDIV (in this case =8).  The value 
             ; of DIV is then passed to the TVMAP routine (which
             ; in turn passes it to the COLORBAR routine).

 NAME:
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT

 PURPOSE:
        Compresses a diverging color table with even number of colors 
        into NCOLORS.  If the /MIDCOLORPRESENT keyword is specified,
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT will also place white or yellow spaces in
        the middle of the color table.

 CATEGORY:
	 Color


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COMPRESS_DIV_CT, R, G, B [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        R, G, B -> The vectors containing the red, blue, and 
             green color values that define the color table.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NCOLORS -> Requested number of colors to be returned.
             If NCOLORS is omitted, then COMPRESS_DIV_CT will
             return without doing anything.

        /MIDCOLORPRESENT -> Set this switch to add 1 or 2 extra
             white or yellow color spaces in the color table.  
            
        /WHITE -> If /MIDCOLORPRESENT is set, this switch will
             cause 1 (if NCOLORS is odd) or 2 (if NCOLORS is even)
             extra white color spaces to be placed
             at the center of the color table.  
            
        /YELLOW -> If /MIDCOLORPRESENT is set, this switch will
             cause 1 (if NCOLORS is odd) or 2 (if NCOLORS is even)
             extra white color spaces to be placed
             at the center of the color table.  ;

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Designed for use with MYCT.  You shouldn't normally 
        have to call COMPRESS_DIV_CT directly.

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        LOADCT, 63, FILE=FILE_WHICH( 'gamap_colors.tbl' )
        TVLCT, R, G, B, /Get

 PURPOSE:
        Defines various customized color tables for use with MYCT.
        Color tables may be stretched to more than the original #
        of colors, or compressed to less than the original # of 
        colors.  You may add more color tables as necessary.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, R, G, B [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS
        /BuWhRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-WHITE-RED 
             (diverging) color table from Harvard University.  This
             color table is a concatenation of the WHITE-BLUE and
             WHITE-RED ColorBrewer colortables.  The center color
             is white.  (Original # of colors = 19)

        /BuWhWhRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED 
             (diverging) color table.  This is a concatenation of 
             the WhBu and WhRd colortables from ColorBrewer.  The two
             center colors in this colortable are white, which makes
             it easier to align colorbar tickmarks at the divisions
             between colors.  (Original # of colors = 20)

        /BuYlRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-YELLOW-RED 
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original 
             # of colors = 12)

        /BuYlYlRd -> Set this switch to load the BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED 
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  The two center
             colors in this colortable are light yellow, which makes
             it easier to align colorbar tickmarks at the divisions
             between colors.  Use this colortable instead of /BuWhWhRd 
             if you need to denote "missing data" values by white.  
             (Original # of colors = 12)

        /DIAL -> Set this switch to load the DIAL/LIDAR (diverging)
             color table from Ed Browell. (Original # of colors = 27)

        /DIFF -> Synonym for /BuWhRd.  Kept for backwards compatibility.

        /ModSpec -> Set this switch to load the MODIFIED SPECTRUM
             (diverging) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original #
             of colors = 11)

        NAME -> Returns to the calling program the name of the color
             table that we have selected.

        NCOLORS -> The number of colors that you would like to be
             included in the colortable.  If NCOLORS is greater than
             the native number of colors for the given colortable,
             the colortable will be stretched to produce a finer
             gradation of colors.  Conversely, if NCOLORS is less
             than the native number of colors, then the colortable
             will be compressed to produce a coarser gradation of
             colors.

        /NOLOAD -> If set, then CUSTOM_COLORTABLE will just return R, 
             G, B to the calling program without loading the colortable.

        /TRUNCATE -> When NCOLORS is less than the number of colors
             in the given color table, setting /TRUNCATE will cause 
             CUSTOM_COLORTABLE to truncate the color table to NCOLORS
             rather than trying to compress it via interpolation.

        /UserDef -> Set this switch to load a user-defined colortable.
             In order to use this option, you must first add the R, G,
             B color vectors into internal routine DEFINE_UserDef.

        /WhBu -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-BLUE (spectral)
             color table from ColorBrewer.  (original # of colors = 10)

        /WhGrYlRd -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-GREEN-YELLOW-RED
             (spectral) color table from A. van Donkelaar.  (Original
             # of colors = 20)

        /WhGyBk -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-GRAY-BLACK 
             (spectral) color table from ColorBrewer.  (Original # 
             of colors = 10)

        /WhRd -> Set this switch to load the WHITE-RED (spectral) color
             table from ColorBrewer.  (original # of colors = 10)

 OUTPUTS:    
        R -> Returns to the calling program the red color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

        G -> Returns to the calling program the green color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

        B -> Returns to the calling program the blue color
             vector that defines the customized colortable.

        DEFINE_WhGyBk

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) For contour plots, the native resolution of the
            custom colortables should be sufficient.

        (2) For smoothed pixel plots, NCOLORS=100 or higher will
            eliminate the streaking caused by TVIMAGE's smoothing
            algorithm.

        (3) Some color tables were adapted from the ColorBrewer
            package (see license info below).

        (4) We will use the ColorBrewer color abbreviations:
               Bk = Black    Br = Brown    Bu = Blue      
               Gr = Green    Gy = Gray     Or = Orange    
               Pi = Pink     Pu = Purple   Rd = Red     
               Wh = White    Yl = Yellow

        (5) An MS Excel spreadsheet with all ColorBrewer color tables 
            is available for download from:
            www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/ColorBrewer_RGB.html

 EXAMPLES:

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, R, G, B, /NOLOAD, /DIAL

             ; Returns the red, green, blue color vectors for the
             ; DIAL colortable at native resolution (26 colors)

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, NCOLORS=120, /DIAL

             ; Loads the DIAL colortable and stretches it 
             ; from 26 to 120 colors.

        CUSTOM_COLORTABLE, /WhGrYlRd

             ; Loads the WHITE-GREEN-YELLOW-RED (spectral) 
             ; color table with 20 colors.
        
 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Adapted from "dial_ct.pro"
                          - Now can compress the colortable if
                            NCOLORS is less than N_ORIG
                          - Added /BuWhWhRd keyword for selecting
                            the BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED colortable
                          - Added /BuYlYlRd keyword for selecting
                            the BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED colortable
                          - /DIFF is now a synonym for /BuWhWhRd
                          - Added /UserDef keyword and internal
                            routine DEFINE_UserDef for selecting
                            a user-defined color table. 
        phs, 12 Feb 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Now create /BuWhRd as a concatenation of
                            the /WhBu and /WhRd colortables.
                          - Updated the interpolation for case of  
                            NCOLORS lt NORIG.  It works fine with all 
                            the 4 diverging colortables, and keeps the 
                            doubling of the middle range color if NCOLORS 
                            is even and BuWhWhRd or BuYlYlRd is used. 
        bmy, 18 Apr 2008: - Bug fix: don't overwrite colortable name

 REQUIREMENTS:
        HCOLORBAR assumes n_elements(COLORS) >= n_elements(LABELS)+1

 NOTES:
       (1) HCOLORBAR is more or less obsolete.  You should use
           the COLORBAR routine instead.  However, there may be
           some applications where HCOLORBAR is required, so we
           keep this routine for backwards compatibility with
           older IDL code.

       (2) The colorbar will be plotted as follows:

             LABELS(0)   LABELS(1)                     LABELS(NL-1)
    +-----------+-----------+----------- // --------------+------------+
    | COLORS(0) | COLORS(1) | COLORS(2)  //  COLORS(NL-1) | COLORS(NL) |
    +-----------+-----------+----------- // --------------+------------+

        COLORS(0) = color index for data < first contour level
        COLORS(1) = color index for data between 1st and 2nd levels
           ...
        COLORS(NL) = color index for data >= the last contour level

        LABELS(0)  = label for the first contour level

 NAME:
        MYCT

 PURPOSE:
        Define a set of standard drawing colors and load a colortable 
        on top of these.  The color table can be manipulated in various 
        ways (see KEYWORD PARAMETERS).

        The standard MYCT drawing colors are as follows.  These
        were implemented by Chris Holmes, based on the ColorBrewer 
        definitions.  These colors are less saturated than the 
        traditional MYCT drawing colors, and are easier to read
        on the screen:

           0 : white              9 : lightblue
           1 : black             10 : lightorange
           2 : red               11 : lightpurple
           3 : green             12 : 85% grey
           4 : blue              13 : 67% grey
           5 : orange            14 : 50% grey
           6 : purple            15 : 33% grey
           7 : lightred          16 : 15% grey
           8 : lightgreen        17 : white

        However, if you use the /BRIGHT_COLORS keyword to MYCT, you
        may still use the traditional MYCT drawing colors (which were
        created by Martin Schultz).  These are defined as follows:

           0 : white             9  : lightgreen
           1 : black             10 : lightblue
           2 : red               11 : black
           3 : green             12 : 85% grey
           4 : blue              13 : 67% grey
           5 : yellow            14 : 50% grey
           6 : magenta           15 : 33% grey
           7 : cyan              16 : 15% grey
           8 : lightred          17 : white
         
        With MYCT, you may load any of the standard IDL color tables
        or any of the ColorBrewer color tables.  For backwards
        compatibility, MYCT also supports several customized color
        tables that used to be defined with the CUSTOM_COLORTABLE
        routine.

        MYCT reads color table definitions from an IDL *.tbl file.
        The default file name is "gamap_colors.tbl".  You may specify
        a different file with the CTFILE keyword (see below).  Also,
        if you wish to add a custom color table, the best way to 
        proceed is to create your own *.tbl file with your custom
        color table definitions.  See the routine GAMAP_COLORS for
        more information.

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MYCT, [ TABLE ] [ , keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        TABLE (optional) -> Number or name of the IDL color table 
             to be used.  If no number or name is provided, the
             routine will default to color table 0 (which for the 
             "gamap_colors.tbl" file is B-W LINEAR).  The MYCT
             drawing colors will be loaded first, and the color
             table will be loaded on top of that.  You can choose
             the bottom color index for the color table with the
             BOTTOM keyword.  MYCT will ensures that the system
             variable !D.N_COLORS is set correctly.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /BRIGHT_COLORS -> Selects the older set of MYCT drawing colors
             to be loaded at the bottom of the colortable.  Default is 
             to select the newer set of MYCT drawing colors, which
             are less saturated and easier to read on the screen.

        BOTTOM -> specify where to start color table (see BOTTOM keyword
             in LOADCT). Default is number of standard drawing colors+1
             or 0 (if NO_STD is set). If BOTTOM is less than the number
             of standard drawing colors (17), no standard colors will be
             defined (equivalent to setting NO_STD).  RANGE has no
             effect on the DIAL/LIDAR colortable.  Default is 18.
             NOTE: You should not normally have to change this value.

        CTFILE -> Specify a file containing the color table
             definitions.  Default is "gamap_colors.tbl", which is
             a combination of the standard IDL color tables plus
             the ColorBrewer color tables.  (See routine GAMAP_COLORS.)

        NCOLORS -> number of color indices to be used by the color table.
             Default is !D.N_COLORS-BOTTOM. 

        /NO_STD -> prevents definition of standard drawing colors.

        RANGE -> a two element vector which specifies the range of colors
             from the color table to be used (fraction 0-1). The colortable
             is first loaded into the complete available space, then
             the selected portion is interpolated in order to achieve the
             desired number of colors.   RANGE is only effective when
             a TABLE parameter is given.  RANGE has no effect on the 
             customized colortables.

        /REVERSE -> Set this switch to reverse the color table.
             /REVERSE works for both IDL and custom color tables.

        SATURATION -> factor to scale saturation values of the extra
             color table. Saturation ranges from 0..1 (but the factor 
             is free choice as long as positive).  SATURATION has no
             effect on the customized colortables.  Default is 1.

        USERDEF -> set to load the user defined colortable. The table
             is defined in the Define_UserDef routine. It can be
             loaded in three different ways:
                  MyCt, -1
                  MyCt, /user
                  MyCt, 'user'
             In the later version, the string is not case sensitive,
             and can be any string that contains the word "user".
               
        VALUE -> factor to scale the "value" of the added colortable.
             (i.e. this is like the contrast knobon a TV set).  Value 
             ranges from 0..1; 0 = black, 1 = white.  Default is 1.

        /USE_CURRENT -> By default, MYCT will reset the color table
             to all white before loading a new colortable.  Set
             /USE_CURRENT to prevent this from happening.

        /VERBOSE -> Set this switch to print out information about
             the color table that has just been selected.

        /XINTERACTIVE -> to call XLOADCT instead of LOADCT for
             interactivity. Has no effect if a custom colortable is
             loaded.


        The following keywords are kept for backwards compatibility.
        These will replicate the color tables that used to be defined
        with the now obsolete CUSTOM_COLORTABLE routine.
        
        /BuWhRd   -> Loads 19-color BLUE-WHITE-RED color table
        /BuWhWhRd -> Loads 20-color BLUE-WHITE-WHITE-RED color table
        /BuYlRd   -> Loads 11-color BLUE-YELLOW-RED color table
        /BuYlYlRd -> Loads 12-color BLUE-YELLOW-YELLOW-RED color table
        /DIAL     -> Loads the 26-color DIAL/LIDAR color table 
                      (cf. E. Browell)
        /DIFF     -> Synonym for /BuWhRd.  
        /ModSpec  -> Loads the 11 color MODIFIED SPECTRUM color table
        /WhBu     -> Loads the 10-color WHITE-BLUE color table
        /WhGrYlRd -> Loads the 20-color WHITE_GREEN-YELLOW-RED color table
                      (cf. Aaron van Donkelaar)
        /WhGyBk   -> Loads the 10-color the WHITE-GRAY-BLACK color
        /WhRd     -> Loads the 10-color the WHITE-RED color table

 NOTES:
        (1) It is recommended to use the COLOR keyword in all PLOT 
            commands. This will ensure correct colors on (hopefully) 
            all devices.  In order to get 256 colors on a postscript 
            printer use DEVICE,/COLOR,BITS_PER_PIXEL=8 

        (2) MYCT will also save several parameters in the MYCT system 
            variable, so that graphics programs can access them.

        (3) MYCT uses the "gamap_colors.tbl" file.  This file
            contains all of the IDL standard color table definitions
            all of the olorBrewer color table definitions, and some
            extra colortables.  If you wish to add a color table
            you should probably use routine GAMAP_COLORS to create
            a new *.tbl file.  Then call MYCT and specify the name
            of the new *.tbl file with the CTFILE keyword.

        (4) We will use the ColorBrewer color abbreviations:
               Bk = Black    Br = Brown    Bu = Blue      
               Gr = Green    Gy = Gray     Or = Orange    
               Pi = Pink     Pu = Purple   Rd = Red     
               Wh = White    Yl = Yellow

        (5) An MS Excel spreadsheet with all ColorBrewer color tables 
            is available for download from:
            www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/ColorBrewer_RGB.html

        (6) NOTE: Use a temporary hack to center the ColorBrewer
            diverging color tables. (phs, 4/23/08)

 EXAMPLES:
        MYCT, 8, /NO_STD     
             ; load IDL colortable green-white (#8)
             ; identical result as loadct,3

        MYCT, 'EOS B', NCOLORS=20  
             ; change first 17 colors to standard drawing colors
             ; and add EOS-B (#27) color table in indices 18-36

        MYCT, 0, NCOLORS=20, /REVERSE, /NO_STD, /Use_Current
             ; add reversed grey scale table on top

        MYCT, 'EOS B', NCOLORS=40, /NO_STD, /Use_Current, $
             RANGE=[0.1,0.7], SATURATION=0.7
             ; add a less saturated version of a fraction
             ; of the EOS-B color table in the next 40 indices
             ; NOTE that color indices above 97 will still contain 
             ; the upper portion of the green-white color table.

        MYCT, 0 /REVERSE     
             ; On b/w terminals MYCT can be used to reverse
             ; the IDL black & white (#0) colortable 

        MYCT, /DIAL, NCOLORS=120
            ; Loads the DIAL LIDAR color table with 120 colors

        MYCT, /BuYlYlRd
        MYCT, 'RdBu', /MIDCOLORPRESENT, /YELLOW, NCOLORS=20
            ; Both of these commands do the same thing: loads
            ; the ColorBrewer "RdBu" colortable and inserts yellow
            ; into the 2 middle colors.  This is a good choice
            ; if you are creating an absolute or % difference plot.

 NAME:
        MYCT_DEFAULTS (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Returns a structure associating the names of MYCT
        drawing colors with their numeric values, plus
        the default bottom and number of colors. 

 CATEGORY:
        Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        C = MYCT_DEFAULTS()

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /GRAYSCALE -> If set, will define a grayscale colortable
             such that the lowest color is white, and the highest
             color is dark grey.  Otherwise the standard "TRACE-P"
             colortable (based on Mac Style #25) will be defined.

        NCOLORS -> Specifies the number of colors for MYCT.  The
             default is 120, but if your terminal can support more,
             you may specify a higher value.

 OUTPUTS:
        C -> Structure with the following tag names:
             WHITE       : Color index for "drawing color" WHITE

        Designed to be used by the GAMAP routine "myct.pro".

 NOTES:
        (1) This routine is designed to be called by MYCT_DEFINE.
        You should not normally have to call MYCT_DEFAULTS.

        (2) MYCT defines a colortable such that the first 17
        colors are "drawing" colors, or pure colors intended
        for use with the PLOT, CONTOUR, MAP_SET, etc. commands.
        MYCT then loads a standard IDL colortable (with NCOLORS
        specifying the number of individual colors) into color
        indices 18  and higher.

        (3) New drawing colors (that are less saturated and
        easier to read on the screen) are now the defaults.
        See the documentation to the MYCT routine for more info.

 EXAMPLE:
        C = MYCT_DEFAULTS()

            ; Defines a grayscale colortable for use w/ MYCT.

 NAME:
       XCOLORS

 PURPOSE:
       The purpose of this routine is to interactively change color tables
       in a manner similar to XLOADCT. No common blocks are used so
       multiple copies of XCOLORS can be on the display at the same
       time (if each has a different TITLE). XCOLORS has the ability
       to notify a widget event handler, an object method, or an IDL
       procedure if and when a new color table has been loaded. The
       event handler, object method, or IDL procedure is then responsibe
       for updating the program's display on 16- or 24-bit display systems.

 CATEGORY:
       Color

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       XCOLORS

 INPUTS:
       None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       BLOCK: If this keyword is set, the program will try to block the
          IDL command line. Note that this is only possible if no other
          widget program is currently blocking the IDL command line. It
          is much more reliable to make XCOLORS a modal widget (see the MODAL
          keyword), although this can generally only be done when XCOLORS
          is called from another widget program.

       BOTTOM: The lowest color index of the colors to be changed.

       COLORINFO: This output keyword will return either a pointer to
          a color information structure (if the program is called in
          a non-modal fashion) or a color information structure (if the program
          is called in modal or blocking fashion). The color information
          structure is an anonymous structure defined like this:

             struct = { R: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current R color vector.
                        G: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current G color vector.
                        B: BytArr(!D.Table_Size), $ ; The current B color vector.
                        NAME: "", $                 ; The name of the current color table.
                        INDEX: 0 }                  ; The index number of the current color table.

          If a pointer to the structure is obtained, you will be responsible
          for freeing it to prevent memory leakage:

             XColors, ColorInfo=colorInfoPtr
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", (*colorInfoPtr).Name
             Ptr_Free, colorInfoPtr

          Note that that Name field will be "Unknown" and the Index field will
          be -1 until a color table is actually selected by the user. You are
          responsible for checking this value before you use it.

          When called in modal or blocking fashion, you don't have to worry about freeing
          the pointer, since no pointer is involved:

             XColors, /Block, ColorInfo=colorInfoData
             Help, colorInfoData, /Structure
             Print, "Color Table Name: ", colorInfoData.Name

       DATA: This keyword can be set to any valid IDL variable. If
          the variable is defined, the specified object method or notify
          procedure will be passed this variable via a DATA keyword. This
          keyword is defined primarily so that Notify Procedures are compatible
          with the XLOADCT way of passing data. It is not strictly required,
          since the _EXTRA keyword inheritance mechanism will allow passing
          of *any* keyword parameter defined for the object or procedure that is
          to be notified.

       DRAG: Set this keyword if you want colors loaded as you drag
          the sliders. Default is to update colors only when you release
          the sliders.

       _EXTRA: This keyword inheritance mechanism will pick up and
          pass along to any method or procedure to be notified and keywords
          that are defined for that procedure. Note that you should be sure
          that keywords are spelled correctly. Any mis-spelled keyword will
          be ignored.

       FILE: A string variable pointing to a file that holds the
          color tables to load. The normal colors1.tbl file is used by default.

       GROUP_LEADER: The group leader for this program. When the group
          leader is destroyed, this program will be destroyed.

       INDEX: The index of the color table to start up. If provided, a color
           table of this index number is loaded prior to display. Otherwise,
           the current color table is used. Set this keyword if you wish
           to have the index number of the event structure correct when
           the user CANCELs out of the progam.

       MODAL: Set this keyword (along with the GROUP_LEADER keyword) to
          make the XCOLORS dialog a modal widget dialog. Note that NO
          other events can occur until the XCOLORS program is destroyed
          when in modal mode.

       NCOLORS: This is the number of colors to load when a color table
          is selected.

       NOSLIDERS: If this keyword is set, the color stretch and color gamma
          sliders are not displayed. This would be appropriate, for example,
          for programs that just load pre-defined color tables.

       NOTIFYID: A 2-column by n-row array that contains the IDs of widgets
          that should be notified when XCOLORS loads a color table. The first
          column of the array is the widgets that should be notified. The
          second column contains IDs of widgets that are at the top of the
          hierarchy in which the corresponding widgets in the first column
          are located. (The purpose of the top widget IDs is to make it
          possible for the widget in the first column to get the "info"
          structure of the widget program.) An XCOLORS_LOAD event will be
          sent to the widget identified in the first column. The event
          structure is defined like this:

          event = {XCOLORS_LOAD, ID:0L, TOP:0L, HANDLER:0L, $
             R:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), G:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), $
             B:BytArr(!D.TABLE_SIZE < 256), INDEX:0, NAME:""}

          The ID field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[0, n] and the TOP
          field will be filled out with NOTIFYID[1, n]. The R, G, and B
          fields will have the current color table vectors, obtained by
          exectuing the command TVLCT, r, g, b, /Get. The INDEX field will
          have the index number of the just-loaded color table. The name
          field will have the name of the currently loaded color table.

          Note that XCOLORS can't initially tell *which* color table is
          loaded, since it just uses whatever colors are available when it
          is called. Thus, it stores a -1 in the INDEX field to indicate
          this "default" value. Programs that rely on the INDEX field of
          the event structure should normally do nothing if the value is
          set to -1. This value is also set to -1 if the user hits the
          CANCEL button. (Note the NAME field will initially be "Unknown").

          Typically the XCOLORS button will be defined like this:

             xcolorsID = Widget_Button(parentID, Value='Load New Color Table...', $
                Event_Pro='Program_Change_Colors_Event')

          The event handler will be written something like this:

             PRO Program_Change_Colors_Event, event

                ; Handles color table loading events. Allows colors be to changed.

             Widget_Control, event.top, Get_UValue=info, /No_Copy
             thisEvent = Tag_Names(event, /Structure_Name)
             CASE thisEvent OF

                'WIDGET_BUTTON': BEGIN

                     ; Color table tool.

                   XColors, NColors=info.ncolors, Bottom=info.bottom, $
                      Group_Leader=event.top, NotifyID=[event.id, event.top]
                   ENDCASE

                'XCOLORS_LOAD': BEGIN

                     ; Update the display for 24-bit displays.

                   Device, Get_Visual_Depth=thisDepth
                   IF thisDepth GT 8 THEN BEGIN
                   WSet, info.wid

                    ...Whatever display commands are required go here. For example...

                    TV, info.image

                 ENDIF
                 ENDCASE

              ENDCASE

              Widget_Control, event.top, Set_UValue=info, /No_Copy
              END

       NOTIFYOBJ: A vector of structures (or a single structure), with
          each element of the vector defined as follows:

             struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, object:Obj_New(), method:''}

          where the Object field is an object reference, and the Method field
          is the name of the object method that should be called when XCOLORS
          loads its color tables.

             ainfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, a, 'Draw'}
             binfo = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, b, 'Display'}
             XColors, NotifyObj=[ainfo, binfo]

          Note that the XColors program must be compiled before these structures
          are used. Alternatively, you can put this program, named
          "xcolors_notifyobj__define.pro" (*three* underscore characters in this
          name!) in your PATH:

             PRO XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ__DEFINE
              struct = {XCOLORS_NOTIFYOBJ, OBJECT:Obj_New(), METHOD:''}
             END

          Or, you can simply define this structure as it is shown here in your code.

          "Extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          the object method, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your methods. If you expect such keywords, your methods should be defined
          with an _Extra keyword.

       NOTIFYPRO: The name of a procedure to notify or call when the color
          tables are loaded. If the DATA keyword is also defined, it will
          be passed to this program via an DATA keyword. But note that *any*
          keyword appropriate for the procedure can be used in the call to
          XCOLORS. For example, here is a procedure that re-displays and image
          in the current graphics window:

             PRO REFRESH_IMAGE, Image=image, _Extra=extra, WID=wid
             IF N_Elements(wid) NE 0 THEN WSet, wid
             TVIMAGE, image, _Extra=extra
             END

          This program can be invoked with this series of commands:

             IDL> Window, /Free
             IDL> TVImage, image, Position=[0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.8]
             IDL> XColors, NotifyPro='Refresh_Image', Image=image, WID=!D.Window

          Note that "extra" keywords added to the XCOLORS call are passed along to
          your procedure, which makes this an alternative way to get information
          to your procedure. If you expect such keywords, your procedure should
          be defined with an _Extra keyword as illustrated above.

       TITLE: This is the window title. It is "Load Color Tables" by
          default. The program is registered with the name 'XCOLORS:' plus
          the TITLE string. The "register name" is checked before the widgets
          are defined. If a program with that name has already been registered
          you cannot register another with that name. This means that you can
          have several versions of XCOLORS open simultaneously as long as each
          has a unique title or name. For example, like this:

            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=0, Title='First 100 Colors'
            IDL> XColors, NColors=100, Bottom=100, Title='Second 100 Colors'

       XOFFSET: This is the X offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

       YOFFSET: This is the Y offset of the program on the display. The
          program will be placed approximately in the middle of the display
          by default.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       Colors are changed. Events are sent to widgets if the NOTIFYID
       keyword is used. Object methods are called if the NOTIFYOBJ keyword
       is used. This program is a non-blocking widget.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       To load a color table into 100 colors, starting at color index
       50 and send an event to the widget identified at info.drawID
       in the widget heirarchy of the top-level base event.top, type:

       XCOLORS, NCOLORS=100, BOTTOM=50, NOTIFYID=[info.drawID, event.top]
