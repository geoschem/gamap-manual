 NAME:
        COMPARE_FLIGHT

 PURPOSE:
        Compare observations from aircraft campaigns to 
        high time-resolution CTM output (bpch files).
        This routine reads aircraft data in binary (bdt) format
        and produces an unlabeld plot and returns all the data
        you might ask for. If an aircraft mission extends beyond
        midnight GMT, the program will ask for a second model file
        which should be from the following day.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        COMPARE_FLIGHT, keywords

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
      DATAFILE -> Name of the aircraft data file or file mask

      MODELFILE -> Name of the (first) model output file or file mask

      TRACER -> tracer number in model output (default=71)

      PSURF -> surface pressure for model grid (default=1013, because most
          aircraft data was sampled over oceans)

      FLIGHTDATA -> returns the observational data array as read
          with gte_readbin. Can also be used to pass flight data if you
          set the USE_DATA flag.

      FLIGHTVARS -> returns the variable names of the observational data.
          Must accompany FLIGHTDATA if you use USE_DATA.

      SPECIES -> the name of the observed species to plot (default CH3I).

      MODELDATA -> returns a time series of model data along the flight 
          track and a couple of min/max values:
             MODELDATA[*,0] = model value in corresponding grid box
                      [*,1] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at same level
                      [*,2] = max ...
                      [*,3] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at level below
                      [*,4] = max ...
                      [*,5] = min of neighbouring grid boxes at level above
                      [*,6] = max ...
          Note that the min/max arrays may contain values from the same
          grid boxes at the edges (i.e. there is no level below the first
          one, hence 3,4 will be identical to 1,2).

      TIME -> returns the time vector of the observations and modeldata

      /USE_DATA -> set this flag if you provide the aircraft data in the
          FLIGHTDATA array and the variable names in FLIGHTVARS. The data
          must contain variables named 'LON', 'LAT', 'ALTP' and SPECIES
          (for SPECIES see above). You must also provide a TIME vector
          which specifies UTC seconds.

 OUTPUTS:
      The extracted data is returned in MODELDATA, several other keywords
      return things read or computed in the process.

 SUBROUTINES:
      EXTRACT__FLIGHT : actual workhorse that does the extraction

 REQUIREMENTS:
      chkstru, ctm_get_data (GAMAP), gte_readbin (GTE)

 NOTES:
      Some hardwiring of default directories.

 EXAMPLE:
      simply  COMPARE_FLIGHT,tracer=1  if all you want is a plot
 
      CONVERT_FLIGHT,tracer=1,modeldata=md,time=time
      plot,time,md[*,0],color=1

                      4 :  vertical
             These values can be combined. E.g., to integrate over 
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE 
             supersedes the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see above).


        FORMAT -> Specifies format for converting numeric values into
             string values, for selected fields (such as LAT and LON).
             Default is I14 (strings are trimmed).

        /NO_SPECIAL -> If set, will not place any special superscript

 NAME:
        CTM_OVERLAY

 PURPOSE:
        Calls TVMAP to plot a pixel or contour map and then overplots 
        either an aircraft flight track or individual station data 
        atop it.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_OVERLAY, DATA,   XMID,   YMID, $
                     TRACKD, TRACKX, TRACKY [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> Data array (e.g. from CTM_GET_DATA or CTM_GET_DATABLOCK)
             from which a pixel plot or contour plot will be generated.

        XMID -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to DATA.

        YMID -> Vector of latitudes corresponding to DATA

        TRACKD -> Vector of data values corresponding to the aircraft
             flight track or station data points.

        TRACKX -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to the aircraft 
             flight track or station data points.  Should be in the 
             range [-180,180].

        TRACKY -> Vector of longitudes corresponding to the aircraft
             flight track or station data points.  Should be in the 
             range [-90,90].

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        C_COLORS -> Vector to specify the color levels for filled
             contour plots.  If not passed, then C_COLORS will return
             to the calling program the default color level values
             generated internally by TVMAP.
 
        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing contour levels for filled
             contour plots.  Used in conjunction with /FCONTOUR. 

        COLOR -> Color of the map outline.  Passed to TVMAP.

        /FCONTOUR -> Set this switch to generate a filled-contour
             plot instead of a pixel plot.

        /LOG -> Set this switch to use a logarithmic color table.

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of DATA.  If omitted, then MINDATA
             will be automatically set to the minimum value of DATA.

        MAXDATA -> Minimum value of DATA.  If omitted, then MINDATA
             will be automatically set to the minimum value of DATA.

        /OVERPLOT -> Set this keyword to overplot a flight track
             atop a map previously drawn by TVMAP.

        T_COLOR -> (1) If plotting aircraft flight track data, then
             T_COLOR will be used to define the color of the line.
             (2) If plotting symbol data, then T_COLOR will be used to
             describe the color of the border around the symbol.  
             To suppress printing a border around the symbol, use
             any negative value for T_COLOR (e.g. T_COLOR = -1).

        T_LINESTYLE -> IDL linestyle for the aircraft flight track.
             Takes same values as the LINESTYLE graphic keyword
             (see help pages).

        T_SYMBOL -> Argument to the SYM keyword, which will be used
             to define the individual data points if you are plotting
             station data.  Recommended value: 1 (filled circle).

        T_THICK -> Thickness of the aircraft flight track, in pixels.
 
        _EXTRA=e -> Passes extra keywords to TVMAP and OPLOT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

                            renamed to CTM_OVERLAY
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
  dbm & bmy, 06 Nov 2007: - Modified to allow filled contour plots
  cdh & bmy, 18 Feb 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Now pass LOG=LOG to TVMAP call to ensure
                            that TVMAP gets the /LOG keyword OK
  bmy & cph, 14 Jan 2010: GAMAP VERSION 2.14
                          - Remove the call to the PLOT command after
                            TVMAP. This does set up the approropriate
                            coordinates for map projections other
                            than /CYLINDRICAL.
                          - Now use PLOTS to plot symbols or lines
                            rather than OPLOT.
                          - Updated comments

                            for filled contour plots if not specified
   bf & bmy, 18 Oct 2010: - Bug fix submitted by Bonne Ford to allow
                            more than one overlay on the same plot
        bmy, 10 Feb 2016: GAMAP VERSION 2.19
                          - If plotting symbols, suppress symbol borders
                            if T_COLOR is negative (e.g. T_COLOR=-1).
                          - Now require adding /NOADVANCE before each 
                            successive call to CTM_OVERLAY with /OVERPLOT

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOT

 PURPOSE:
        General plotting tool for CTM data that is stored in the 
        GAMAP datainfo and fileinfo structures. CTM_PLOT can 
        handle everything from 0-D to 3-D and has many different
        plot options, especially for 2-D plots for which it was
        originally designed. E.g. full map support.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOT, [ Diagn [ [ ,Keywords ] ] 

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> The diagnostic number (e.g. ND22, ND45, etc or 
             category name (e.g. "JV-MAP", "IJ-AVG") for which to 
             read data from the punch file. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    Keyword parameters passed to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK:
    ===============================================
        FILENAME -> Name of the punch file to read data from.  
             FILENAME is passed to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.  You can also
             use a file mask, in which case FILENAME will return the 
             full filename if it is a named variable. If an empty 
             filename is provided, the default search mask from 
             gamap.defaults (see gamap.cmn) will be used. If no 
             filename is given, ctm_plot will try 
             to find the records from data already loaded.

        TRACER -> Number of tracer to read from the punch file.

        TAU0, /FIRST, /LAST -> time step to be plotted

        LON -> If /INDEX is set, LON denotes the CTM longitude index
             of the box to plot.  Otherwise, LON denotes the actual
             longitude value of that box. (that is at box CENTER, phs
             4/2/08)

        LAT -> If /INDEX is set, LAT denotes the CTM latitude index
             of the box to plot.  Otherwise, LAT denotes the actual
             latitude value of that box. (that is at box CENTER, phs
             4/2/08)

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element
             vector specifying the min and max sigma levels to be 
             included in the plot.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].
 
        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude
             values to be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure 
             levels to be included in the extracted data block.

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as CTM 
             indices.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON
             as the actual values of latitude, level, and longitude.
             NOTE: If /INDEX is set, then GAMAP cannot create plots
             for longitude ranges that span the date line!!!

        AVERAGE -> If = 0, will not average the data 
                      = 1, will average data longitudinally
                      = 2, will average data latitudinally
                      = 4, will average data vertically
             These are cumulative (e.g. AVERAGE=3 will average over 
             both lat and lon, and AVERAGE=7 will average over lat,
             lon, and vertical levels to produce 1 data point).
                       
        TOTAL -> If = 0, will not total data
                    = 1, will total data longitudinally
                    = 2, will total data latitudinally
                    = 4, will total data vertically
             These are cumulative (e.g. TOTAL=3 will total over both 
             lat and lon, and TOTAL=7 will total over lat, lon, and 
             vertical levels to produce 1 data point).

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATABLOCK will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO and USE_DATAINFO must be consistent, and should
             either both be used or omitted. However, it is
             possible to provide the global FILEINFO structure 
             (or nothing) with a local subset of DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

    Keywords passed to CTM_CONVERT_UNIT:

             line in TVMAP.PRO.  Default is to print grid labels
             for each grid line.

        /NOISOTROPIC -> Will suppress plotting of an isotropic map
             (i.e. one with the same X and Y scale).  Default is to 
             print an isotropic map.
  
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the 
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map. If you find
             that one or more color bands are not filled properly, 
             try the /CELL_FILL keyword. This is a known IDL precularity.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, TVMAP will use quasi-logarithmic levels.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for each line (or
             each fill section) of the contour map.  If not
             specified, TVMAP will select default colors from the 
             colortable.

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS 
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector, 
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS 
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise, 
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the 
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to 
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling. 

             NOTE: If C_LABELS is given as a scalar, then it will be
             expanded to a vector with all elements having the same value.

        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.

        /OVERPLOT -> Add an additional line plot to an existing one.
             You should specify LINE=n and/or COLOR=n to distinguish 
             between curves in this case. You can manually add a legend
             with legend.pro after the plot(s) are produced.
             Note that the title string will contain information on 
             your first selection only. Use an explicit TITLE for 
             best results.

        /SAMPLE -> Will cause REBIN (in TVMAP) to use nearest-
             neighbor sampling rather than bilinear interpolation.

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are quasi-logarithmic.

        /POLAR -> Create a polar plot. Note that the longitude range must 
             be -180..180 and the latitude range must extend to one pole
             but not straddle the equator.


    Keywords passed to ISOPLETH_MAP:
    ================================
        ISOPLETH -> Value for which a 3-D isosurface will be computed.
             ISOPLETH_MAP assigns a default value of 35.0.  


    Other Keywords:
    ===============
        USTR -> Unit string to be plotted to the right of the colorbar.  
             If not specified, then CTM_PLOT  will construct a unit 
             string based on the value of TRACERINFO.UNIT.
             NOTE: USTR is a synonym for the keyword CBUNIT, which
             specifies the color bar unit string.

        THISDATAINFO -> Returns to the calling program the THISDATAINFO
             structure obtained by CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.

        LABELSTRU -> Returns to the calling program the structure
             of label information obtained by CTM_LABEL.
 
        YRANGE -> range of y values for color scaling (default:
             scale each plot seperately with data min and max)

        X_FORMAT, Y_FORMAT (optional) -> Specifies the format string
             (e.g. '(f10.3)', '(e14.2)' ) for the X and Y axes, when
             making line plots.  If omitted, CTM_PLOT will call
             GET_DEFAULTFORMAT to compute default format strings. 

        RESULT -> A named variable will contain the data subset that was
             plotted together with the X and/or Y coordinates in a structure.
             For 1D plots, either X or Y are -1. 3D visualization returns
             a structure including the Z coordinate.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATABLOCK,
             CTM_LABEL, TVMAP, and TVPLOT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===========================================================
        CTM_DRAW_CUBE                  CONVERT_LON
        CTM_TRACERINFO                 CTM_CONVERT_UNIT
        TVMAP                          TVPLOT
        CHKSTRU           (function)   MYCT_DEFAULTS     (function)
        CTM_GET_DATABLOCK (function)   CTM_LABEL         (function) 
        REPLACE_TOKEN     (function)   CTM_BOXSIZE       (function)   
        GET_DEFAULTFORMAT (function)   GAMAP_CMN     (include file)   

        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        Also assumes colortable has been loaded with "myct.pro". 

 NOTES:
        (1) Some keywords are saved in local variables with 
        slightly different names (e.g. MCONTOUR for /CONTOUR) 
        to prevent confusion with routine names and/or keywords
        that are picked up by the _EXTRA=e facility.

        (2) Not every possible combination of keywords has been thoroghly 
        tested. *PLEASE* report reproducible errors to mgs@io.harvard.edu!!

        (3) As of 11/17/98, CTM_PLOT can only produce X-Y plots with
        either PRESSURE or ALTITUDE along the left Y-Axis.  The right
        Y-Axis is left disabled (but will fix that later on...) 

        (4) Now define X-axis labels for longitude.  The labels are
        defined correctly for data blocks that span the date line.

 EXAMPLE:
        (0)
        CTM_PLOT
             ; To plot an ozone surface map (default) of a 
             ; user-selected file

        (1)
        FileName = '~/terra/CTM4/run_code/ctm.pch.sep1'
        CTM_PLOT, 22, 1, FileName=FileName, Lev=[1,14], $
           Total=4, /NoErase 

             ; Plots vertically-summed map for tracer 1 of ND22
             ; (J-Values map).  Will erase screen before plotting map.

        (2)
        CTM_PLOT, 'JV-MAP-$', 1, FileName=FileName, Lev=[1,14], $
           Total=4, /NoErase 

             ; Same as above, but uses category name instead of 
             ; diagnostic number.

                            (interface to TVPLOT) : ** still needs work! **
                          - changed CBAR to NOCBAR
        bmy, 12 Nov 1998: - TRACER is now a keyword instead of
                            an argument

                          - renamed C_LABELS to C_ANNOTATION to
                            prevent keyword name confusion
                          - added NOLINES, NOLABELS, C_LABELS,
                            and OVERLAYCOLOR keywords for tvmap
                          - now gets default colors from 
                            DEFAULT_COLORS.PRO
                          - Error checking for LIMIT keyword
                            (OK for now...fix this later on...)
        bmy, 16 Nov 1998: - Now use %DATE% instead of %YMD1% for
                            all default plot titles
                          - now enhanced for TVPLOT v. 2.0
                          - now only convert units for a tracer 
                            if the default unit is different from
                            the desired unit!!
        bmy, 17 Nov 1998: - added /PRESSURE keyword to plot pressure
                            instead of altitude on the left Y-axis
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998: - messed around quite a bit, because of 
                            (unfortunate) changes in default_range !@#$!@
                          - added CBFormat keyword
        bmy, 23 Nov 1998: - eliminated %SCALE% token from UNITSTR,
                            to be consistent with the latest
                            upgrade to COLORBAR.PRO. 
                          - now pass SECONDS to CTM_CONVERT_UNIT
        bmy, 13 Jan 1999: - add support for line plots.  Also, if
                            the DATA array is averaged down to a
                            single point, will print the value of
                            that point and exit.
                          - use NEWXTITLE and NEWYTITLE as token-replaced
                            strings for XTITLE and YTITLE
        bmy, 15 Jan 1999: - add support for 3-D visualization plots
                          - added unit string for contour plots
                          - now place CTM_LABEL call after the case
                            statement for PLOTTYPE, so that we can
                            suppress printing of special characters
                            in plot titles.
        bmy, 19 Jan 1999: - improve 0-D output
                          - fixed [XY]Titles for line plots
                          - "unitless" is now a unit string option
                          - now use new default color names from
                            DEFAULT_COLORS.PRO

        mgs, 22 Jan 1999: - couple bug fixes, some code cleaning
                          - added OverPlot keyword to allow multiple
                            line plots
        bmy, 19 Feb 1999: - now pass DEBUG (from GAMAP_CMN) to 
                            CTM_GET_DATABLOCK via DEBUG keyword
                          - Rename XIND, YIND, ZIND keywords to
                            XMID, YMID, ZMID, in call to CTM_GET_DATABLOCK
        bmy, 23 Feb 1999: - Add XTICKNAME, XTICKS, XTICKV in call to
                            TVPLOT...fix for map regions smaller than 
                            the globe
                          - bug fix.../NOGRID was listed as GRID!!!
                          - added keyword /NOGLABELS, which
                            suppresses grid line labels in MAP_SET 
                          - updated comments
        bmy, 26 Feb 1999: - now calls MAP_LABELS to get latitude labels
                            for X, XZ, Y, YZ plot types.
                          - updated comments
        bmy, 04 Mar 1999: - now pass DEBUG keyword to TVMAP
                          - now use GRIDINFO.XEDGE, GRIDINFO.YEDGE
                            to compute the LIMIT keyword for MAP_SET
        mgs, 18 Mar 1999: - minor cleaning
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: - added ILun to keyword list to prevent retrieval
                            of two otherwise identical records from two
                            different files
        bmy, 25 Mar 1999: - now line plots use MULTIPANEL
                          - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                            higher above the window, to allow for 
                            carriage-returned lines
                            for X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ plots
        mgs, 25 Mar 1999: - no unit conversion if not necessary
                          - small fix to allow for 2D fields (e.g. EPTOMS)
        bmy, 14 Apr 1999: - now prints unit string at lower right of
                            XZ or YZ plots, if the colorbar is not
                            plotted
        bmy, 26 Apr 1999: - rename YRANGE to YYRANGE internally, so as
                            to avoid confusion with YRANGE plot keywords   
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - removed a few too explicit keyword settings
                            for 1D plots and fixed OverPlot option.
                            Now stores !X, !Y, and !P from last 1D plot
                            in a local common block.
        mgs, 21 May 1999: - restore !X, !Y, and !P at the end of each
                            1-D plot to allow overplotting of data.
        mgs, 25 May 1999: - needed to mess around with lonrange to get
                            it right.
        mgs & bmy, 26 May 1999: - added POLAR keyword
        bmy, 27 May 1999: - bug fix: CBUnit keyword wasn't honored

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Prints a lat-lon map of 2 CTM fields, their absolute difference, 
        and their percent difference.  This is a quick way of ensuring 
        that two model versions are producing identical results.

        The page will contain the following plot panels:

             Panel #1               Panel #2
             Data Block D1          Data Block D2

             Panel #3               Panel #4
             Abs Diff (D2 - D1)     % Diff (D2 - D1)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF, DIAGN, FILE1, FILE2 [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: "IJ-AVG-$"). 

        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file.  If FILE1
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file.  If FILE2
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:


        LON -> A 2-element vector specifying the longitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-180,180].

        LAT -> A 2-element vector specifying the latitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-88,88].

        LEV -> A scalar or 2-element vector which specifies the
             level(s) that will be used to make the plot.  Default
             is [ 1, 1 ].

        /PS -> Set this switch to print to a PostScript file.
 
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the PostScript file if the /PS option 
             is set.  Default is "idl.ps".

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which differences will be plotted.  

        TAU0 -> TAU value(s) (hours since 0 GMT 1 Jan 1985) at the start
             of the diagnostic data block to plot.

        DIVISIONS -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the quantity plot (Panels #1 and #2).  Default is 5.
             NOTE: The optimal # of divisions is !MYCT.NCOLORS/2 +1.

        DATARANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values of the data that will appear on the plot (Panels
             # 1 and #2).  The default is to automatically compute
             the overall min and max of both data blocks.

        MIN_VALID -> Specifies the minimum valid data for the plot. 
             Data lower than MIN_VALID will be rendered with color
             !MYCT.WHITE.  For example, MIN_VALID is useful for
             plotting emissions which only occur on land.

        DIFFDIV -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 8.
             NOTE: The optimal # of divisions is !MYCT.NCOLORS/2 +1.

        DIFFNCOLORS -> Sets the # of colors used to create the
             difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 13.

        DIFFRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the absolute difference
             plot (Panel #3).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the absolute difference data (symmetric around zero).

        /NODEVICE -> set to not call open_device, so you can do it
             from outside

        /NOMULTIPANEL -> set to not call multipanel, so you can do it
             from outside

        PCRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the percentage difference
             plot (Panel #4).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the percentage difference data (symmetric around zero).

        PCDIV -> number of ticks in the %-Diff colorbar

        PCNCOLORS -> number of colors for the %-Diff plot

        T1, T2, DIFFTITLE -> allows you to overwrite the default
             title for the 1st, 2nd and DIff plots.


        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_DIFF,
             OPEN_DEVICE, and MYCT


   Keywords for the MASK feature:
   ------------------------------
        /MASK -> set to mask with a green color boxes where %-diff
             and/or diff are below some threshold. The absolute value
             of the % is plot.

	 PC_THR, DIFF_THR : the %-Diff and Diff THResholds to mask data in the
             4th plot if /MASK is set. Boxes with %-Diff or/and Diff
             below the THResholds are masked. Default values are 1%
             and 1e4.

        /ZAP -> set to skip all plots if /MASK is set and all boxes
             are masked.


 OUTPUTS:
        none

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =======================================================
        CHKSTRU     (function)    CLOSE_DEVICE 
        CTM_CLEANUP               COLORBAR_NDIV     (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_PLOTDIFF calls CTM_CLEANUP each time to remove
            previously read datablock info from the GAMAP common
            block.

        (2) The default TAU0 value is 0, and is not suitable if your 
            run has no output for 0 GMT 1 Jan 1985! You may have to 
            gather tau0 before running and crashing CTM_PLOTDIFF.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILE1 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-30'
        FILE2 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-31'
        CTM_PLOTDIFF, 'IJ-AVG-$', FILE1, FILE2, TRACER=1

             ; Creates 4-panel plot w/ old data, new data,
             ; new - old (abs diff), and new - old (% diff).

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOTDIFF4

 PURPOSE:
        Prints a lat-lon map of 2 CTM fields, their absolute difference, 
        and their percent difference.  This is a quick way of ensuring 
        that two model versions are producing identical results.

        The page will contain the following plot panels:

             Panel #1               Panel #2
             Data Block D1          Data Block D2

             Panel #3               Panel #4
             Abs Diff (D2 - D1)     % Diff (D2 - D1) / D1

        CTM_PLOTDIFF4 is a lighter version of CTM_PLOTDIFF, and does
        not use CTM_DIFF as an intermediary routine.

        MIN_VALID -> Specifies the minimum valid data for the plot. 
             Data lower than MIN_VALID will be rendered with color
             !MYCT.WHITE.  For example, MIN_VALID is useful for
             plotting emissions which only occur on land.

        DIFFDIV -> Specifies the number of colorbar divisions for 
             the difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 8.
             NOTE: The optimal # of divisions is !MYCT.NCOLORS/2 +1.

        DIFFNCOLORS -> Sets the # of colors used to create the
             difference plots (Panels #3 and #4).  Default is 13.

        DIFFRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the absolute difference
             plot (Panel #3).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the absolute difference data (symmetric around zero).

        /NODEVICE -> set to not call open_device, so you can do it
             from outside

        /NOMULTIPANEL -> set to not call multipanel, so you can do it
             from outside

        PCRANGE -> Allows you to manually specify the min and max
             values that will appear on the percentage difference
             plot (Panel #4).  Default is to use the dynamic range of
             the percentage difference data (symmetric around zero).

        PCDIV -> number of ticks in the %-Diff colorbar

        PCNCOLORS -> number of colors for the %-Diff plot

        TITLE_1 -> Allows you to override the default plot title for
             the first data block (1st plot panel).

        TITLE_1 -> Allows you to override the default plot title for
             the 2nd data block (2nd plot panel).

        DIFFTITLE -> Allows you to override the default plot title for
             the absolute difference plot (3rd plot panel).

        PCTITLE -> Allows you to override the default plot title for
             the percent difference plot (4th plot panel).

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_DIFF,
             OPEN_DEVICE, and MYCT


   Keywords for the MASK feature:
   ------------------------------
        /MASK -> set to mask with a green color boxes where %-diff
             and/or diff are below some threshold. The absolute value
             of the % is plot.

	 PC_THR, DIFF_THR : the %-Diff and Diff THResholds to mask
	      data in the 4th plot (percent difference) if /MASK is
	      set.  Boxes with %-Diff or/and Diff below the THResholds
	      are masked. Default values are 1% and 1e4.

        /ZAP -> set to skip all plots if /MASK is set and all boxes
             are masked.;

 NOTES:
        (1) When plotting a subset of the globe, CTM_PLOTDIFF4
            properly sets the colorbar ranges for the abs diff
            and percent diff plots.  This was an issue in the
            older CTM_PLOTDIFF.

        (2) Longitude and latitude ranges specified by LON and LAT
            will be applied to both data blocks.  

 EXAMPLE:
         CTM_PLOTDIFF4, 'IJ-AVG-$',                      $
                        'v8-03-02.bpch', 'v9-01-01.bpch, $

 NAME:
        CTM_PLOTRATIO

 PURPOSE:
        Plots the ratio of two CTM data fields.  This is one way
        to see if two model versions produce identical results.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PLOTRATIO, DIAGN [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection.  Default is "IJ-AVG-$". 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file (containing the
             "old" data).  If FILE1 is not given, or if it contains 
             wildcard characters (e.g. "*"), then the user will be 
             prompted to supply a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file.  If FILE2
             is not given, or if it contains wildcard characters
             (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted to supply
             a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        LON -> A 2-element vector specifying the longitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-180,180].

        LAT -> A 2-element vector specifying the latitude range that
             will be used to make the plot.  Default is [-88,88].

        LEV -> Vertical level for which to plot data.  Default is 1.

        TITLE -> Title string for the plot.  If not specified, a
             generic title string will be generated.

        TRACER -> Number of the tracer for which differences
             will be plotted.  Default is 1.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_DIFF.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

        CTM_DIFF      EXTRACT_FILENAME  (function)
        OPEN_DEVICE   CLOSE_DEVICE
        MULTIPANEL

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) The ratio plotted will be DATA2 / DATA1, where DATA2
            is contained in FILE2, and DATA1 is contained in FILE1.

        (2) For places where DATA1 = 0, DATA2 will also be set to 0.
            This avoids division by zero errors.

        (3) CTM_PLOTRATIO calls CTM_CLEANUP each time to remove
            previously read datablock info from the GAMAP common
            block.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILE1 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-30'
        FILE2 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-31'
        CTM_PLOTRATIO, 'IJ-AVG-$', $
             FILE1=FILE1, FILE2=FILE2, TRACER=1, LEV=1

             read data from the punch file. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be loaded
             used in the color map and color bar.  The default is
             to use the value in system variable !MYCT.BOTTOM.

        COLOR -> Color of the plot window and/or data.  The default
             is to use the system variable !MYCT.BLACK.

        LABELSTRU -> Returns to the calling program the structure
             of label information obtained by CTM_LABEL.

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element
             vector specifying the min and max sigma levels to be 
             included in the plot.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].
 
        OVERPLOT -> Plot data atop the previous plot window, instead
             of erasing the screen and plotting in a new window.

        RESULT -> A named variable will contain the data subset that
             was plotted together with the X and/or Y coordinates in
             a  structure.  

        TITLE -> Top title string for the plot.  If not passed, 
             then a default title string will be printed.

             to. If not specified, then no unit conversion will be done.

        XTITLE -> X-Axis title string for the plot.  If not passed, 
             then a default title string will be printed.

        YTITLE -> Y-Axis title string for the plot.  If not passed, 
             then a default title string will be printed.

        YRANGE -> range of y values for color scaling (default:
             scale each plot seperately with data min and max)

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for routines called
             by CTM_PLOT_TIMESERIES.

 NAME:
        GAMAP

 PURPOSE:
        Menu-driven user interface for creating plots with
        the GAMAP package subroutines. The actual data retrieval
        and plotting is done with ctm_plot.pro. This routine
        mainly collects all user requests and passes them on to
        CTM_PLOT.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GAMAP, [ DiagN [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: use all).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        General keywords:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        FILENAME -> CTM output file name. Default is to display a
             pickfile dialog and let the user select. You can have
             wildcards ('*', '?') in your filename which restricts
             the file selection.

        /NOFILE -> Don't query for filename but display all records that
             have already been loaded. This can save you a couple of
             mouse clicks when you want to create several plots with
             data from one file, and it also useful when you want
             to plot data from 'external' files that were converted
             with ctm_make_datainfo. If a filename is given or no
             data were loaded, the file selection dialog will appear
             anyhow.

        /RESETDEFAULTS -> If set, will reset all GAMAP values to their
             defaults.

        /HELP -> Displays a help page.

        RESULT -> Returns a structure with the data subset as plotted and
             the respective X and Y coordinates. Returns only one data
             record though.

        TOPTITLE -> Add a specific title centered on top of each page
             of output.

        Keywords to restrict the number of records displayed for selection:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        TRACER -> A tracer number to restrict record selection

        TAU0 -> Time value (at beginning of record)

        DATE -> 6 digit date (e.g. 940101) at the beginning of the
             output record (this gets translated into a TAU0
             value via the function nymd2tau). You can specify more
             than one date at a time using a vector (e.g. [940101, 940301]).
             For the GISS model(s), you also have to specify /GISS_Date in
             order to get correct tau values. The time is assumed to
             be 00 GMT. For other times use the TAU0 keyword as
             TAU0=nymd2tau(dates,times).

        /GISS_Date -> set this flag if you are using the DATE keyword
             with GISS model output.

        Keywords defining output options (these override defaults in
        gamap.defaults)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        /PS -> If set, will directly send output to the 'idl.ps' file.
             If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether to create
             the 'idl.ps' file.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of file to send PostScript output to.

        /NOTIMESTAMP -> Do not include a user ID and time stamp
             on the postscript plot. Unnecessary if the TIMESTAMP value
             in gamap.defaults is set to 0.

        XSIZE, YSIZE, XOFFSET, YOFFSET -> GAMAP will pass these
             keywords to routine OPEN_DEVICE, for setting the size
             and margins of PostScript output.  

        /DO_BMP -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to BMP files.  DO_BMP overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        BMPFILENAME -> Name of BMP file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in BMPFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             BMPFILENAME is not set, or if DO_BMP is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             BMPFILENAME.

        /DO_GIF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as GIF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to GIF files.  DO_GIF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        GIFFILENAME -> Name of GIF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in GIFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             GIFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_GIF is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             GIFFILENAME.

        /DO_JPEG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as BMP
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to JPEG files.  DO_JPEG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        JPEGFILENAME -> Name of JPEG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in JPEGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             JPEGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_JPEG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             JPEGFILENAME.

        /DO_PNG -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as PNG
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to PNG files.  DO_PNG overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        PNGFILENAME -> Name of PNG file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in PNGFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             PNGFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             PNGFILENAME.

        /DO_TIFF -> If set, GAMAP will save animation frames as TIFF
             files.  If not set, GAMAP will prompt the user whether
             to save animation frames to TIFF files.  DO_TIFF overrides
             the default setting in "gamap.defaults".

        TIFFFILENAME -> Name of TIFF file to save animation frames to.
             If the token %N% is used in TIFFFILENAME, then GAMAP
             will replace %N% with the actual frame number.  If
             TIFFFILENAME is not set, or if DO_PNG is set to *QUERY in
             "gamap.defaults", GAMAP will prompt user to supply
             TIFFFILENAME.

        /POLAR -> Set this keyword for polar pots. This forces latitude
             ranges to extend to one pole and longitude ranges to span
             the globe. Polar plots only work for global (at least 
             longitudinally) data sets.  Currently, polar plots are 
             supported only for contour plots.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_PLOT, etc...

            are processed much faster and allow "windowing" of output.

        (2) For pixel plots, GAMAP can only plot cylindrical maps
            with rectangular projections.  Arbitrary map projections
            should be possible with any type of contour plot. For 
            polar plots, use the /POLAR keyword. Other projections 
            have not been tested and may lead to unexpected results.

        (3) GAMAP forces map ranges to coincide with the grid box
            edges, so that the map and pixel plot will be aligned.
            Each "pixel" size corresponds to one full grid box.
            For grids with half-polar boxes, it is therefore recommended
            not to plot the polar latitudes, since those boxes will
            show up as full-size boxes and shift the rest of the plot
            accordingly.

        (4) When the user selects multiple data blocks, GAMAP will produce
            a multi-panel plot if !p.multi indicates more than one panel
            on the screen (use the MULTIPANEL procedure to turn it on).
            If you plot only one panel per screen, GAMAP will automatically
            start XInterAnimate to present your own movie to you. Be
            aware that XInterAnimate is limited by your system resources.
            With default window sizes, we can usually display at least
            30 frames.  ADDENDUM: 3-D isopleth maps will not be
            animated. (bmy, 1/22/01)

        (5) Animation frames can also be written to GIF or MPEG
            files.  Defaults can be set in "gamap.defaults", or
            specified via the command line. You can also save individual
            GAMAP plots as GIF files. If you want to animate them later
            (e.g. using ULead's GIF-Animator), make sure to specify the
            RANGE keyword to get identical color schemes (or use contours).

        (6) The GAMAP authors wish to point out that it is still relatively
            expensive to produce color plots on the printer. We encourage
            you to try out contour plots and make a test print on a black
            and white printer before you make a color print.

        (7) The 3-D isopleth maps do not quite work with MULTIPANEL, since
            they are produced with screen capture in the Z-Buffer.  Hence  
            Hence, the X window device has to be re-initialized each time, 
            which negates the MULTIPANEL utility.  PostScript plots of 3-D
            isopleth maps will print one plot per page.  We can live with
            this for the time being.  Isopleth maps can also be written
            to GIF files.

        (8) Now uses D. Fanning's TVREAD function to perform better
            device-independent screen capture. (cf. www.dfanning.com)

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        GAMAP
            ; operates fully interactively

        MULTIPANEL,nplots=6       ; turn on multi-panel environment
        GAMAP
            ; same as above, but produce multi-panel plots with
            ; 6 plots per page

        (2)
        GAMAP, 'IJ-AVG-$', tra=4
            ; Will create a CO (tracer=4) plot for the ND45 diagnostic.
            ; GAMAP will display dialog pickfile box and will scan the
            ; file for all records with ND45 and tracer 4. Those will be
            ; displayed and the user can then select a record to be plotted.

        (3)
        GAMAP, [ 'IJ-AVG-$', 'BIOBSRCE' ], tra=[2,4], $
               date=[19940601, 19940801], $
            FileName='~bmy/terra/CTM4/ctm.pch',/ps
            ; In this example the file is fully specified, hence no file
            ; selection dialog will be displayed. GAMAP scans the file
            ; for all records of 'IJ-AVG-$' and 'BIOBSRCE' and tracers
            ; 2 (OX) and 4 (NOX) and it seelcts only those records that
            ; begin on the first of JUNE or AUGUST 1994. Because the ps
            ; flag is set, the output will be directed to the postscript
            ; file 'idl.ps' without first being displayed on the screen.

                          - updated comments
        bmy, 17 Feb 1999: VERSION 1.20
                          - Replace DATAINFO.OFFSET by DATAINFO.FIRST,
                            which contains the I, J, L indices of
                            the first grid box
                          - Animation facility added
                          - added functions GAMAP_GetModelInfo,
                            GAMAP_CheckDataBlockConsistency,

                            GAMAP_QueryPostScriptOptions.
                          - Also renamed function GAMAP_SelectDataBlock to
                            GAMAP_SelectDataBlocks, since one can now
                            select multiple data blocks

                            boxes, since TVIMAGE will treat them as
                            whole boxes and the map overlay will be
                            inaccurate!

        mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added ALREADY_PS flag for multi-panel use
                          - animation now only if !p.multi does not
                            have more than 1 panel to display
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: - improved comments and examples
                          - removed unnecessary function MatchFileInfo...
                            (easier with make_selection)
                          - changed all "string booleans" to booleans
                          - Do_Animation now an entirely local variable
        mgs, 25 Mar 1999: - few minor bug fixes
                          - improved handling of default ranges
                          - detect out of range in record selection
                          - now allows for 2D field plots
        bmy, 17 May 1999: - now resolve DEFAULT_RANGE explicitly and
                            call DEFRANGE_STR2NUM separately
                          - few minor fixes in GAMAP_UserRangeEntry for
                            data blocks that straddle the date line.
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - some more cleaning
                          - implemented SAVE option after data record
                            selection
                          - user selection for longitudes greatly improved
                          - some adjustments in FindNearestEdges, notably
                            for range 0..360. Unfortunately, the 0 meridian
                            gridline will be omitted in such plots. If we
                            wanted to include it we would need to carry
                            an extra GLOBAL flag because lower and upper
                            edges (grid box indices) are identical.
        mgs, 20 May 1999: - added option to save record seelction to file.
        mgs, 24 May 1999: - yet more work had to be done to make lon/lat
                            selection as user would expect it to work.
                          - renamed FindNearestEdges to ..Centers
        mgs, 25 May 1999: - still more fiddling. Yuck!

 NAME:
        PLANE_PLOT

 PURPOSE: 
        Plots data from the GEOS-CHEM plane following diagnostic
        atop a world map.  Multiple flights can be plotted.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        PLANE_PLOT, VAR, FLTID [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        VAR -> Variable name for which to plot data.  VAR should
             match the variable names in the GEOS-CHEM input file

        FLTID -> Flight ID(s) for which to plot data.  These should
             match the flight ID's in the GEOS-CHEM input file
             "Planeflight.dat" (e.g. P3B01, DC801, etc.)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file containing GEOS-CHEM plane 
             following diagnostic output.  If FILENAME is omitted,

 NAME:
        TSDIAG

 PURPOSE:
        Reads and plots CTM time series (station) data. The
        data are returned in a structure together with longitude,
        latitude, altitude, and time information. TSDIAG tries to
        construct a time vector from the TAU information stored
        in the file. This may not always work (e.. it is assumed 
        that time steps are 1 hour).
           While reading, TSDIAG displays a '.' for each new station
        encountered, and a '+' if a station is continued. If you want 
        more detailed output, set the /VERBOSE flag.

        %%% NOTE: May need updating %%%

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME    -> Path of the input file containing CTM 
                       Data data.

        SCALE -> A global scale factor that will be applied to all
                 data. Default is 1. Note that concentration data is
                 stored as v/v, hence for ppt you should set 
                 SCALE=1.E-12.

        /VERBOSE -> display detailed information on what is being read.
                 
        /PLOT -> set this flag to produce quick-and-dirty plots of the 
                 time-series data.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> A structure containing LON, LAT, ALT and Data data
               together with TRACER and a "global" TIME array.

 SUBROUTINES:
        OPEN_DEVICE               CLOSE_DEVICE
        CTM_TRACERINFO            FILE_EXIST (function)
        STRSCINOT (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NOTES:
        Lines with the Data data (Header = 'TB' or 'DV') will be
        read from disk.  Statistics are ignored for now.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; read time series data from file and return result structure

 NAME:
        TVMAP

 PURPOSE:
        TVMAP produces one of the following plots:
          (1) A color-pixel image,   overlaid with a world map
          (2) A line-contour plot,   overlaid with a world map
          (3) A filled-contour plot, overlaid with a world map

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TVMAP, Data, [ Xarr, YArr [ [, keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> 2-D array of values to be plotted as a color map.
             The first dimension is longitude, the second is latitude.

        XARR, YARR -> If plotting a line-contour map or filled-contour map,
             then XARR is the array of X-axis values, and YARR is the
             array of Y-Axis values that are needed to construct the
             the contours.  XARR and YARR are not needed to produce a
             color-pixel image map; however, if XARR and YARR are
             passed, TVMAP will be able to label the longitude and
             latitude lines accordingly and set the proper default limits.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        BLACK -> The color index corresponding to black.
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK.

        /CONUS -> a Lambert's azimuthal equal area projection for
             CONtiguous U.S., w/ specific LIMIT and P0lat, P0lon, Rot.

        MAX_VALID -> maximum valid data value for color-pixel plots
             Data above MAX_VALID will be shown in white, unless
             TOPOUTOFRANGE is set to another color index.

        MIN_VALID -> minimum valid data value for color-pixel plots.  
             (or minimum contour level for contour plots).  Data 
             below MIN_VALID will be shown in white, unless
             BOTOUTOFRANGE is set to another color index.

        TOPOUTOFRANGE ( BOTOUTOFRANGE ) -> color index to indicate
             data above MAX_VALID (below MIN_VALID). Default is
             white. The color is also shown with a box (or TRiangle)
             near the colorbar (if any). If negative, the box is not
             shown with the colorbar.

        /NOERASE -> This keyword prevents erasing the screen (or page)
            when setting a multi-panel environment or after a page was
            filled.  /NOERASE is automatically turned ON when the /OFF
            keyword is given.  NOTE: On the PostScript device, when
            the page is filled, it automatically places the next plot
            on the next page.  You can use the /NOERASE keyword to
            suppress this behavior, especially if you are manually
            placing plots on the page.

        CSFAC -> Character size for the map labels and X, Y titles.
             Default settings for CSFAC vary according to the number
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        TCSFAC -> Character size for the top title.  Default
             settings for TCSFAC vary according to the number
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        /NOADVANCE -> Set this switch to prevent TVMAP from advancing
             to the next plot panel on the page.  This is useful if
             you desire to overplot something atop the pixel map or
             contour map.

        /POLYFILL -> to use IDL POLYFILL routine instead of MAP_IMAGE
             to do the pixel plot (see /SAMPLE). Use this keyword
             with default cylindrical projection only. Use it also if
             you think that MAP_IMAGE does not neatly reproduces the
             boxes.

        /RECTANGLE -> to plot a rectangle around the map. Default is
             to have one for non-polar projection, and none for polar 
             projection. Set to 0 or 1 to override default.  NOTE:
             setting the /HORIZON keyword will disable this option.

        /SAMPLE -> to do "pixel plot" (ie grid boxes are colored)
             instead of contour. 

        /HORIZON -> Set this switch to call IDL routine MAP_HORIZON
             to draw a horizon line around the boundaries of the map.
             Use this feature if the map projection you are using is
             elliptical or interrupted.  NOTE: /HORIZON will override
             override the /RECTANGLE keyword setting.

        WINDOWPOSITION -> Returns the position of the plot window
             in normal coordinates to the calling program.  This can
             be used by a subsequent call to PLOT if you want to
             overplot symbols atop the contour or pixel plot created
             by TVMAP.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords (not listed below, unless
             noted) for BYTSCL, COLORBAR, TVIMAGE, MAP_SET, MAP_GRID,
             MAP_CONTINENTS, MAP_LABELS and CONTOUR.

    Keywords passed to both BYTSCL and COLORBAR:
    ============================================
        MAXDATA -> Maximum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is max( DATA ).

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is min( DATA ).

        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be used
             for byte-scaling the color map and colorbar.  Default
             is 20 (or !D.N_COLORS-1 if 20 is too large).

        NCOLORS -> This is the maximum color index that will be used.
             Default is 120 (or !D.N_COLORS-BOTTOM, if 120 is too large).

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are quasi-logarithmic.

    Additional keywords passed to COLORBAR:
    =======================================
        /CBAR -> If set, will plot a horizontal colorbar below the
             map in the position specified by CBPOSITION.  Default is
             to NOT plot a colorbar.

        CBCOLOR -> Color index of the colorbar outline and
             characters.  Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        CBPOSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the colorbar.  CBPOSITION
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot.
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08].

        CBUNIT -> Passes the Unit string to COLORBAR, which will be
             plotted to the right of the color bar.

        CBFORMAT -> format to use in call to colorbar. Default is I12
             if abs(max(data)) < 1e4, else e12.2 (strings get trimmed)

        CBMIN, CBMAX -> Explicitly sets the min and max values of
             the colorbar range.  If not set, TVMAP will set
             CBMIN = min( DATA ) and CBMAX = max( DATA ).

        CBTICKLEN -> Specifies the color bar tick length as a
             fraction of the colorbar height (for horizontal
             colorbars) or width (for vertical colorbars).

        CBVERTICAL -> If set, will plot a vertical bar on the right
             side of the map.

        CBSCALE -> If set, then the printed tick labels are scaled by
             powers of 10 to minimize overlap.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels for the colorbar.  Default is 4.

        /TRIANGLE -> to replace box that indicate Out Of Range data 
             with a triangle.

        TOPLEVELVALUE -> to define the last annotation of the
             colorbar when using the C_LEVELS keyword

    Keywords passed to MAP_SET:
    ===========================
        COLOR -> Color index of the map outline and title characters.
             Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        MPARAM -> A 3 element vector containing values for
             [ P0Lat, P0Lon, Rot ].  Default is [ 0, 0, 0 ].
             Elements not specified are automatically set to zero.

        /ISOTROPIC  -> If set, will produce a map with the same scale
             in the X and Y directions.  Default is not to plot an
             isotropic-scale map. Note, however, that if TVMAP is
             called from CTM_PLOT, the default is to plot a map that
             keeps the aspect ratio (which is about the same as
             isotropic).

        LIMIT -> A four-element vector which specifies the latitude
             and longitude extent of the map.  The elements of LIMIT
             are arranged thus: [ LatMin, LonMin, LatMax, LonMax ].
             Default is to set LIMIT = [ -90, -180, 90, 180 ] (i.e.
             to include the entire globe). P0Lon will be computed
             to fit into the LIMIT range unless it is explicitely
             requested in MParam.

        POLAR -> Plot a polar stereographic projection. If set and
             equal 1 then the plot goes from the pole to a latitude
             defined by either the extend of the data or by the user
             through the LIMIT keyword. If set and equal to 2, then
             the full hemisphere is plot, regardless of the data or
             LIMIT settings.
              Note that setting the /STEREOGRAPHIC keyword wouldn't
             work.

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot.
             Default is [0.0, 0.15, 1.0, 1.0] with Horizontal Color
             Bar, and [0., 0., 0.82, 1.0] with Vertical CBar.

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible"
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in
            subsequent plot commands.  MARGIN can either be one value
            which will be applied to all four margins, or a 2-element
            vector which results in equal values for the left and
            right and equal values for the bottom and top margins,
            or a 4-element vector with [left,bottom,right,top].  The
            default MARGIN setting is [ 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.07 ].

        OMARGIN -> specify a page margin around all panels in normalized
            coordinates. Works like MARGIN.

        SCALEMAPSET -> To pass the SCALE keyword to MAP_SET.

        TITLE -> The title string that is to be placed atop the
             plot window.  TITLE is passed explicitly to avoid keyword
             name duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.


    Keywords passed to MAP_LABELS:
    ==================================
    
        LATS, LONS -> Array of latitudes (longitudes) used to
            construct the map labels.  If LATS has one element, the
            LATS vector is build with LATS+n*DLAT, with as n as
            needed to cover the map range. If it has more than one
            element, it is not modified and it is the final grid.

        DLAT, DLON -> Latitude (longitude) interval between grid
            lines. Passed with _extra.


    Keywords passed to MAP_CONTINENTS:
    ==================================
        /CONTINENTS -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to plot
             continent outlines or filled boundaries.  Default is 0.

        /COUNTRIES -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to draw the
             political boundaries of countries as of 1993.

        /COASTS -> If set, will call MAP_CONTINENTS to draw the coast
             lines of continental regions.

        CCOLOR -> The color index of the continent outline or fill
             region.  Default is BLACK (see above).

        CFILL -> Value passed to FILL_CONTINENTS keyword of MAP_CONTINENTS.
             If CFILL=1 then will fill continents with a solid color
             (as specified in CCOLOR above).  If CFILL=2 then will fill
             continents with hatching.

        /USA -> Set this switch to turn on US State boundaries.

    Keywords passed to MAP_GRID:
    ============================
        /BOX_AXES -> If set, then MAP_GRID will print alternating
             light & dark regions with the lon & lat labels around
             the border of the plot.  This is passed directly to
             MAP_GRID.  NOTE: BOX_AXES is the default for the CONUS
             option.

        /GRID -> If set, will call MAP_GRID to plot grid lines and
             labels. Labels can be turned off with /NOGLABELS.
             Default is _not_ to plot grid lines.

        GCOLOR -> The color index of the grid lines. Default is
             BLACK (see above).

        /NOGXLABELS -> If set, TVMAP will suppress printing longitude
             labels for each grid line.

        /NOGYLABELS -> If set, TVMAP will suppress printing latitude
             labels for each grid line.

    Keywords passed to CONTOUR:
    ===========================
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled-contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, will use preset default levels.

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for contour lines or
             fill regions.  If not specified then will use uniformly
             spaced default color levels.  If C_COLORS is set to a
             scalar value, then all contour lines will have the same
             color value.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector,
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise,
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling.

        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.

    Keywords passed to MAP_IMAGE (prior: to REBIN):
    ==============================================
        /SAMPLE -> Used to rebin the byte-scaled image array to a
             larger size.  If /SAMPLE is set, then MAP_IMAGE will use
             nearest-neighbor sampling rather than bilinear
             interpolation. 

    Keyword passed to TVIMAGE:
    ===============================================
        SCALEMAPIMAGE -> Sets the number of pixels per graphic coordinate
             in PostScript and other devices with scalable
             pixels. Larger values produce better resolution output,
             but much larger file sizes. The default value is
             0.04. Use a larger number for higher resolution if your 
             image does not exactly fit on the map projection. 

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External subroutines required:

        COLORBAR          ( by Martin Schultz & David Fanning )
        TVIMAGE           ( by David Fanning                  )

        MYCT_DEFAULTS     ( by Bob Yantosca                   )

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Assumes that a MYCT colortable has been loaded.

 NOTES:
        (1) The _EXTRA facility now picks up keywords for multiple
        routines (this is a new feature in IDL v. 5.0+!!)

        (2) Some keywords are saved in local variables with
        slightly different names (e.g. MCONTOUR for /CONTOUR)
        to prevent confusion with routine names and/or keywords
        that are picked up by the _EXTRA=e facility.

        (4) For contour plots, contour labels will be specified
        using the C_ANNOTATION keyword.  The downside is that
        by using C_ANNOTATION, this disables the C_LABELS keyword
        and so one cannot specify which contour lines will get
        labels.  The solution would be to expand the C_LABELS
        vector so that it has the same number of elements as
        C_ANNOTATION, and then to individually zero the
        corresponding elements of C_ANNOTATION before making
        the contour plot.  Don't have enough time for this now,
        but maybe can deal with this at a later time...

        (5) Now references the !MYCT system variable.  This should
        be defined at the start of your IDL session when "myct.pro"
        is called from "idl_startup.pro".

 LIMITATIONS:

       (1) The case of plot over the dateline is working fine only if
       LIMIT[3] is negative and LIMIT[1] is positive. Other cases are
       not specifically handled and results may not be reliable.


       (2) Since we are using MAP_IMAGE, pixel plots do start and end
        at longitude and latitude centers of the grid by default,
        like contour plots. More map coverage is done in three cases:

          (2a) Data sets that cover the globe will fill the map with
          coarse pixel plots.
         
          (2b) Data sets that cover the globe will fill the map only
          in the longitude direction with smooth pixel and contour
          plot. Plots start and stop at the first and last latitudes
          centers.
         
          (2c) Data sets that do not cover the globe will start and
          end at grid edges with coarse pixels, only if the limit of
          the map is less than half grid size away from the the
          first/last latitude and longitude centers. This limitation
          is due to the method used to pad the data outside the
          domain delimited by X/Y arrays.

       (3) MAP_IMAGE assumes that an evenly spaced data set is
       passed. If X or Y array is not evenly spaced, pixels plots are
       flawed and not reliable. Contour plots are ok.

                            annoying "cushion" space.
                          - added LOG keyword for logarithmic

                          - P0Lon now computed from LIMIT information.
                          - Updated call to map_labels
                          - For contour plots: XArr, YArr no longer
                            mandatory (although they should be provided)
                          - much smarter default contour levels
        mgs, 22 Mar 1999: - added multi-panel ability through use of
                            the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                            meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now
                            refer to positions in the current plot panel!
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999: - fixed a few minor things
                          - charsize is now adjusted according to number
                            of panels on page
        bmy, 25 Mar 1999: - If CBAR=0, then print unit string below
                            plot (formerly was done in CTM_PLOT)
                          - now use updated GET_DEFAULTFORMAT
                          - updated comments
                          - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                            higher above the window, to allow for
                            carriage-returned lines
        mgs, 23 Apr 1999: - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for
                            tighter colorbar control
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - title shifted a little higher if it has
                            more than 1 line.

        bmy, 27 May 1999: - bug fix for isotropic contour plots
        mgs, 27 May 1999: - added support for discrete colorbars and
                            changed default behaviour for filled
                            contour plots: now plots a colorbar and
                            no lines.
        bmy, 03 Jun 1999: - For polar plots, if the latitude range
                            spans more than 60 degrees, only plot
                            labels for [ 30, 60, 90 ] degrees.
        mgs, 03 Jun 1999: - CFill now also allowed for filled contours
                            or pixel plots (data will be overplotted)
        bmy, 09 Jun 1999: - Set CBUnit to '' if nothing passed
        bmy, 21 Jun 1999: - Added MIN_VALID keyword.
        bmy, 06 Jul 1999: - bug fix for min_valid: ge replaces gt.
        bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                            define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                            appear in Postscript plots
                          - multi-panel plots are now well-separated
                            from each other (for PostScript output)
        bmy, 08 Jul 1999: - more minor fixes
        bmy, 18 Nov 1999: - increase default left margin by a little
        bmy, 31 Mar 2000: GAMAP VERSION 1.45
                          - make CSFAC and TITLECSFAC into keywords
        bmy, 10 May 2000: - make sure XARR and YARR (if passed) are 1D vectors
                          - now use XARR, YARR to set default limits
                          - rearranged keyword settings code for clarity
                          - added more debug output (when /DEBUG is set)
        bmy, 26 May 2000: - updated comments
        bmy, 13 Jun 2000: - added /COUNTRIES and /COASTS keywords.

                            will now invoke routine MAP_CONTINENTS
        bmy, 30 Jan 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.47
                          - if NOGLABELS=0 and GRID=0, will print out
                            grid labels w/o printing out grid lines
                          - added MARGIN keyword for MULTIPANEL
                          - also allow coarse plots with /SAMPLE
                            when using the Z-buffer device
        bmy, 07 Jun 2001: - removed some obsolete code & comments
        bmy, 02 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48

                            to suppress printing either lon or lat
                            grid labels, if so desired.
        bmy, 13 Jul 2001: - bug fix: remove _EXTRA=e from MAP_SET call
                            when making pixel plots.  This prevents extra
                            grid lines from being drawn on the map.
        bmy, 23 Jul 2001: - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                            values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                            if these keywords are not passed explicitly.
        bmy, 31 Oct 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.49
                          - add /NOADVANCE keyword to prevent advancing
                            to the next page (in case you want to overplot)
        bmy, 08 May 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.50
                          - If the data array has more than 100,000 elements,
                            then assign it a dithering factor of 1, so that
                            we don't run out of memory when trying to plot it
        bmy, 20 Jun 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                          - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword to return
                            the position vector of the plot window
                            region to the calling program

        bmy, 14 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                          - If GLABELS=0, then this also sets GXLABELS=0
                            and GYLABELS=0.
                          - Removed obsolete keywords
                          - Removed reference to MYCT_DEFAULTS.
        bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                          - added OMARGIN keyword so that we can put
                            an outer margin around all plot panels
        bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                            C_COLORS to the calling program
                          - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the

  tmf & bmy, 04 Oct 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.05
                          - Replace /ERASE keyword with /NOERASE
                            to facilitate manual positioning of
                            plots.  Pass /NOERASE to MULTIPANEL.
  bmy & phs, 18 Sep 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Don't reset data below MIN_VALID to 
                            MIN_VALID for contour plots

                          - add support for VERTICAL COLORBAR
                          - add support for CONUS projection
                          - now all map projections are supported for
                            all 4 types of plots.
                          - now data Latitudes and Longitudes (X/Yarr)
                            are taken into account in Pixel
                            plot: no more need to clip the data
                            before plotting, TVMAP will do it, like
                            it already does for Contour plots.
                          - added Full Hemisphere Polar plot option,
                            regardless of DATA range and LIMIT keyword
                          - added RECTANGLE keyword to overwrite
                            default behavior
                          - map plotting coordinate system active at
                            exit, allowing for easy oplot
                          - default LIMIT for small data set corrected
                          - various fixes for across-the-dateline plots

                            non-global smooth pixel and contour
                            plots.
                          - plots start and end at box edges in few 
                            new cases.
                          - replace /CENTER with /MINUS_ONE in call

        phs, 12 Feb 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Fixes for MIN_VALID and MAX_VALID 
                          - The test for the LIMIT keyword is now to check
                            "if ( n_elements(limit) ne 4 )".  This allows you
                            to disable the LIMIT keyword by also setting
                            LIMIT=0.
        phs, 28 Feb 2008: - Couple of small padding improvements
                          - added SCALEMAPSET and SCALEMAPIMAGE to pass
                            their respective SCALE keyword to MAP_SET and
                            MAP_IMAGE.
                          - LONS and LATS keyword added, so the grid can
                            be specified. Work with DLAT and DLON, the
                            grid spacings that can be passed to MAP_LABELS
                            thru the _extra keyword.
  cdh & phs, 21 Mar 2008: - added minimum support for LIMIT input as
                            8-elements vector
        phs, 17 Apr 2008: - Added the TopOutOfRange and BotOutOfRange
                            keywords, so default color (white) for Out-Of
                            -Range data can be overwritten.
        phs,  6 May 2008: - Added the GXLABELS and GYLABELS keywords
                            to specify which grid line to label.
        phs, 19 Jun 2008: - Set default SCALE value for MapImage
                            (ScaleMapImage keyword) to 0.04 if PS device.

                            for NaN and Infinite data 
 cdh, eml, phs, 19 Sep 2009: - Now C_LEVELS works with pixel plots and
                            any projection.
                          - Added LATS, LONS (to specify the grid), and
                            TOPLEVELVALUE (to specify the last level
                            in the colorbar when using C_LEVELS)
                            keywords
                          - fixed limit of CONUS projection

 NAME:
        TVPLOT

 PURPOSE:
        TVPLOT produces one of the following plots:
          (1) A color-pixel image,   overlaid atop X-Y plot axes
          (2) A line-contour plot,   overlaid atop X-Y plot axes
          (3) A filled-contour plot, overlaid atop X-Y plot axes

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TVPLOT, Data, Xarr, Yarr, [, keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> 2-D array of values to be plotted.
        
        XARR -> array of X-axis (horizontal axis) values needed to
             construct the plot.  The number of elements in XARR must
             equal the number of elements of the first dimension of DATA.

        ZARR -> ZARR is the array of Z-axis (vertical axis) values
             needed to construct the plot.  The number of elements
             in ZARR must equal the number of elements of the second
             dimension of DATA.  If ZARR[0] > ZARR[N_Elements(ZARR)-1]
             then TVPLOT will assume pressure is to be plotted on the
             Y-axis.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        BLACK -> The color index corresponding to black.
             Default is !MYCT.BLACK (from !MYCT system variable.)

        /NOERASE -> This keyword prevents erasing the screen (or page)
            when setting a multi-panel environment or after a page was
            filled.  /NOERASE is automatically turned ON when the /OFF
            keyword is given.  NOTE: On the PostScript device, when
            the page is filled, it automatically places the next plot
            on the next page.  You can use the /NOERASE keyword to
            suppress this behavior, especially if you are manually
            placing plots on the page.
 
        CSFAC -> Character size for the map labels and plot titles. 
             Default settings for CSFAC vary according to the number 
             of plots per page and type of plot device.

        /NOADVANCE -> Set this switch to prevent TVMAP from advancing
             to the next plot panel on the page.  This is useful if
             you desire to overplot something atop the pixel plot or
             contour plot.

        MARGIN -> specify a margin around the plot in normalized
            coordinates. This keyword does not change any IDL
            system variables and will thus only become "visible"
            if you use the POSITION returned by MULTIPANEL in
            subsequent plot commands.  MARGIN can either be one value
            which will be applied to all four margins, or a 2-element
            vector which results in equal values for the left and
            right and equal values for the bottom and top margins,
            or a 4-element vector with [left,bottom,right,top].  The
            default MARGIN setting is [ 0.05, 0.04, 0.00, 0.02 ].
            -> adds 0.02 to the left margin for Y-axis title
            -> adds 0.03 to the bottom margin for X-axis title
            -> adds 0.03 to the right margin for vertical color bar
            -> adds 0.02 to the top margin for more than 2 plots/page

        OMARGIN -> specify a page margin around all panels in normalized
            coordinates. Works like MARGIN.

        WINDOWPOSITION -> Returns the position of the plot window
             in normal coordinates to the calling program.  This can
             be used by a subsequent call to PLOT if you want to
             overplot symbols atop the contour or pixel plot created
             by TVPLOT.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords (not listed below) for
             BYTSCL, COLORBAR, TVIMAGE, MAP_SET, MAP_GRID,
             MAP_CONTINENTS, and CONTOUR.


    Keywords for both BYTSCL and COLORBAR:
    ======================================
        MAXDATA -> Maximum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is max( DATA ).

        MINDATA -> Minimum value of the DATA array to use in the
             byte scaling.  Default is min( DATA ).

        BOTTOM -> The lowest color index of the colors to be used
             for byte-scaling the color map and colorbar.  Default 
             is !MYCT.BOTTOM (from the !MYCT system variable).

        NCOLORS -> This is the maximum color index that will be used.
             Default is !MYCT.NCOLOR (from the !MYCT system variable).

        /LOG -> Will create a color-pixel plot with logarithmic
             scaling.  /LOG has no effect on line-contour or
             filled-contour plots, since the default contour levels
             are logarithmic.


    Additional keywords for COLORBAR:
    =================================
        /CBAR -> If set, will plot the colorbar below the map in the 
             position specified by CBPOSITION.  Default is to NOT
             plot a colorbar.
 
        CBCOLOR -> Color index of the colorbar outline and
             characters.  Defaults to BLACK (see above).

        CBPOSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the colorbar.  CBPOSITION 
             has the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08]. 

        CBUNIT -> Passes the Unit string to COLORBAR, which will be
             plotted to the right of the color bar.

        CBFORMAT -> format to use in call to colorbar. Default is I12
             if abs(max(data)) < 1e4, else e12.2 (strings get trimmed)

        CBMIN, CBMAX -> Explicitly sets the min and max values of
             the colorbar range.  If not set, TVPLOT will set 
             CBMIN = min( DATA ) and CBMAX = max( DATA ).

        CBTICKLEN -> Specifies the color bar tick length as a
             fraction of the colorbar height (for horizontal
             colorbars) or width (for vertical colorbars).

        CBSCALE -> If set, then the printed tick labels are scaled by
             powers of 10 to minimize overlap.
 
        DIVISIONS -> Number of labels for the colorbar.  Default is 4.

        /CBVERTICAL -> Will draw a vertical colorbar instead of
             a horizontal one.  Default is to draw a horizontal
             colorbar.


    Keywords for INTERPOLATION:
    ===========================
    
        /SAMPLE -> Used to get COARSE pixel plot. REBIN is called,
             and uses the nearest-neighbor sampling.
             Note that REBIN is used even if SAMPLE is not set, when
             device is PostScript. It uses the bilinear interpolation
             then.

        /NOZINTERP -> set to switch off the vertical
             interpolation. This can be used only if the ZARR is
             evenly spaced.


    Keywords for PLOT:
    ===================

        BOTOUTOFRANGE -> Color index for data below
             MIN_VALID. Default is white, or last color in color
             table if !MYCT is not defined. If set to negative, the
             color is used in the plot only, and not in the colorbar. 

        POSITION -> A four-element array of normalized coordinates
             that specifies the location of the map.  POSITION has
             the same form as the POSITION keyword on a plot. 
             Default is [0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9]. 

        TITLE -> The title string that is to be placed atop the
             plot window.  TITLE is passed explicitly to avoid keyword
             name duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.
  
        COLOR -> Color index for the plot window outline and titles.  
             Default is BLACK.

        XSTYLE, YSTYLE -> Style settings for the X and Y axes.  See 
             the "Graphics Keywords" settings man page for more info.
             XSTYLE and YSTYLE are passed as explicit keywords to
             avoid keyword name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        XRANGE, YRANGE -> Two-element vectors for the X-axis and Y-axis 
             plot ranges, of the form [Xmin,Xmax] and [YMin,Ymax].
             XRANGE and YRANGE are passed as explicit keywords to
             avoid keyword name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        XTITLE, YTITLE -> Titles for the X and Y axes.  XTITLE and 
             YTITLE are passed as explicit keywords to avoid keyword 
             name confusion in the _EXTRA=e facility. 

        NOXLABEL, NOYLABEL -> Suppress printing tick labels for X and Y axes.


    Keywords for CONTOUR:
    =====================
        /CONTOUR -> Will produce a line-contour map instead of the 
             default color-pixel image map.

        /FCONTOUR -> Will produce a filled-contour map instead
             of the default color-pixel image map.

        C_LEVELS -> Vector containing the contour levels.  If not
             specified, will use preset default levels (see below).

        C_ANNOTATION -> Vector containing the contour labels.
             Default is to use string representations of C_LEVELS.

        C_FORMAT -> Format string used in converting C_LEVELS to
             the default C_ANNOTATION values.  Default is '(f8.1)'.

        C_COLORS -> Index array of color levels for contour lines or
             fill regions.  If not specified then will use uniformly
             spaced default color levels.  If C_COLORS is set to a 
             scalar value, then all contour lines will have the same
             color value.

        C_LABELS -> Specifies which contour levels should be labeled.
             By default, every other contour level is labeled.  C_LABELS 
             allows you to override this default and explicitly
             specify the levels to label. This parameter is a vector, 
             converted to integer type if necessary.  If the LEVELS 
             keyword is specified, the elements of C_LABELS
             correspond directly to the levels specified, otherwise, 
             they correspond to the default levels chosen by the 
             CONTOUR procedure. Setting an element of the vector to 
             zero causes that contour label to not be labeled.  A
             nonzero value forces labeling.
 
        /C_LINES -> Will overplot a filled-contour map with contour lines
             and labels instead of plotting a colorbar. This was the old
             default behaviour but has been changed with the advent of
             "discrete" colorbars. The old NOLINES keyword is kept
             for compatibility reasons but doesn't do anything.

        /NOLABELS -> Will suppress printing contour labels on both
             line-contour and filled-contour maps.

        OVERLAYCOLOR -> Color of the solid lines that will be
             overlaid atop a filled contour map.  Default is BLACK.


 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==================================================
        COLORBAR              GET_DEFAULTFORMAT (function)        
        INV_INDEX (function)  LOGLEVELS (function)  
        TVIMAGE          
        
 REQUIREMENTS:
        Assumes that a MYCT colortable has been loaded.

 NOTES:
        (1) The _EXTRA facility picks extra keywords for BYTSCL,
            TVIMAGE, PLOT and COLORBAR, etc...  This is a new 
            feature in IDL v. 5.0+!! 

        (2) For contour plots, contour labels will be specified
            using the C_ANNOTATION keyword.  The downside is that
            by using C_ANNOTATION, this disables the C_LABELS keyword
            and so one cannot specify which contour lines will get
            labels.  The solution would be to expand the C_LABELS
            vector so that it has the same number of elements as
            C_ANNOTATION, and then to individually zero the
            corresponding elements of C_ANNOTATION before making
            the contour plot.  Don't have enough time for this now,
            but maybe can deal with this at a later time...

 EXAMPLE:
        POSITION   = [0.1, 0.1,  0.9, 0.9 ] ; position for map
        CBPOSITION = [0.1, 0.05, 0.9, 0.08] ; position for colorbar

        TVPLOT, DATA, XARR, YARR,                           $
               MAXDATA=MAXDATA,    MINDATA=MINDATA,         $
               POSITION=POSITION,  CBPOSITION=CBPOSITION,   $
               /ERASE,             TITLE='Avg O3',          $
               XTITLE='Longitude', YTITLE='Altitude',       $
               DIVISIONS=4,        FORMAT='(F6.2)'

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 27 Apr 1998:  VERSION 1.00
        bmy, 04 Jun 1998:  - now can plot separate X or Y axes
                             if [XY]STYLE = 4 or 8
        mgs, 15 Jun 1998:  - bug fix n_elements instead of keyword_set
                           - now does spline interpolation in the
                             vertical in order to get correct
                             altitudes
        bmy, 21 Sep 1998:  - Rename EXTRA1, EXTRA2, etc, to names
                             that have more meaning (e.g. E_BYT for
                             BytScl, E_TV for TVImage, etc.)
        bmy, 22 Sep 1998:  VERSION 1.10
                           - now uses _EXTRA=e facility to pass extra
                             keywords to BYTSCL, TVIMAGE, PLOT, and
                             COLORBAR.
                           - add PLOTTITLE (for PLOT) and UNIT (for
                             COLORBAR) keywords to prevent keyword
                             name duplication in _EXTRA=e.
        mgs, 11 Nov 1998:  - added CBar keyword
        bmy, 16 Nov 1998:  VERSION 2.00
                           - now can produce line-contour and filled-
                             contour plots as well as image plots
                           - now calls REBIN to rebin the byte-scaled
                             image array to higher resolution for
                             PostScript output.
                           - added the following keywords: /LOG,
                             /SAMPLE, /CONTOUR, /FCONTOUR, C_ANNOTATION,
                             C_LEVELS, C_LABELS, /NOLABELS, /NOLINES, 
        bmy, 17 Nov 1998:  - For image plots, now only display plot axes
                             AFTER the image plot has been made.  This
                             reduces the "apparent" wait time for the 
                             user.
                           - renamed keywords to XA_TITLE, XA_RANGE, 
                             XA_TICKNAME, etc to avoid keyword name
                             duplication in the _EXTRA=e facility.
        mgs, 17 Nov 1998:  - added CBFormat keyword
        bmy, 18 Nov 1998:  - also added floating point format for 
                             CBFORMAT when abs(max(Data)) < 10
        mgs, 19 Nov 1998:  - CBFormat no whandled in colorbar.pro
        bmy, 27 Jan 1999:  - added defaults for XRANGE and YRANGE
        bmy, 08 Jan 1999:  - If /LOG is set, make sure that we don't
                             take the log of zero and incur a math error
                           - add call to function INV_INDEX  
        mgs, 18 Mar 1999:  - cleaned up
                           - now uses loglevels and has smarter default 
                             contour levels
        mgs, 22 Mar 1999:  - added multi-panel ability through use of
                             the new MULTIPANEL routine. This alters the
                             meaning of MPosition and CB_Position: they now
                             refer to positions in the current plot panel!
        mgs, 23 Mar 1999:  - fixed a few minor things
                           - charsize is now adjusted according to number
                             of panels on page
        bmy, 25 Mar 1999:  - now use updated GET_DEFAULTFORMAT
                           - if NPANELS >=2 then place the plot title
                             higher above the window, to allow for 
                             carriage-returned lines
                           - updated comments
        bmy, 27 Apr 1999:  - commented out !x.charsize=csfac and
                             !y.charsize=csfac lines...these messed
                             up the plot window sizes
                           - updated comments
        bmy, 28 Apr 1999:  - added CBMin and CBMax keywords for 
                             tighter colorbar control
        mgs, 19 May 1999: - title shifted a little higher if it has
                            more than 1 line.
        mgs, 21 May 1999: - variable name for TITLE now MTITLE as in
                            TVMAP.
        mgs, 27 May 1999: - changed default behaviour for filled contours:
                            now plots "discrete" colorbar and no lines.
                            Keyword NoLines changed to C_Lines.
        bmy, 10 Jun 1999: - CBUnit defaults to '
        mgs, 06 Jul 1999: - adjusted charsize for multipanel plots
        bmy, 07 Jul 1999: - Save C_COLORS in a temp variable.  Also
                            define C_COLORS so that grayscales won't
                            appear in Postscript plots
                          - multi-panel plots are now well-separated
                            from each other (for PostScript output)
        bmy, 08 Jul 1999: - more minor fixes
        bmy, 18 Nov 1999: - increase default left margin by a little
        bmy, 31 Mar 2000: GAMAP VERSION 1.45
                          - made CSFAC a keyword
        bmy, 23 Jul 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.48
                          - now call MYCT_DEFAULTS to specify default
                            values for BLACK, BOTTOM, NCOLORS, etc
                            if these keywords are not passed explicitly.
        bmy, 07 Jul 2001: - removed obsolete code from 1998 and 1999
        bmy, 31 Oct 2001: GAMAP VERSION 1.49
                          - add /NOADVANCE keyword to prevent advancing
                            to the next page (in case you want to overplot)
        bmy, 28 Sep 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.51
                          - now gets MYCT default parameters from the
                            !MYCT system variable
        bmy, 15 Nov 2002: GAMAP VERSION 1.52
                          - Added MIN_VALID keyword to skip missing
                            data values for pixel plots
        bmy, 18 Dec 2003: - For pixel plots, now linearly interpolate
                            when creating NDATA instead of using a
                            cubic spline.  This is more accurate.
                          - Prevent NDATA from being extrapolated wildly
                            due to the slope at the surface and top level
                            of the plot.  
        bmy, 06 Jan 2003: - Now interpolate NDATA correctly when pressure
                            or altitude is on the Y-axis.
                          - Removed obsolete keywords XA_TITLE, YA_TITLE,
                          - XA_RANGE, YA_RANGE, XA_TICKNAME, YA_TICKNAME
                          - Now define default YRANGE = [ ZBOT, ZTOP ]
                            to make Y-axis labels correct for both pressure
                            and altitude on the Y-axis.
                          - Removed ZBOT, ZTOP from the keyword list; 
                            these are now internal variables. 
                          - updated comments
        bmy, 02 Mar 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.02
                          - added MARGIN keyword a la TVMAP
                          - added OMARGIN keyword
        bmy, 28 May 2004: - Now returns the modified value of
                            C_COLORS to the calling program
                          - added CBTICKLEN keyword to specify the
                            color bar tick length
        bmy, 30 Nov 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - added WINDOWPOSITION keyword  
        bmy, 12 Jul 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - added /ISOTROPIC keyword
                          - added /NOZINTERP keyword to prevent interpolation
                            to a fine grid of 100 pts in the vertical dim.
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
  bmy & phs, 26 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                          - Minor fix for margins w/ for new TVIMAGE
                          - Also reset !P.MULTI=0 when using TVIMAGE
                            so that it will use the internally computed
                            position vector.  Reset after TVIMAGE call.
                          - Make sure to label last colorbar division
                            for contour plots
                          - Vertical colorbar options and MIN_VALID, 
                            MAX_VALID keywords are the same as TVMAP
                          - Extra space is now added to the default
                            MARGIN values for vertical colorbar
                            and multiple plots per page.
                          - Adjust default CBPOSITION values such
                            that the colorbar will be placed either
                            0.05 below or 0.02 to the right of the plot
        phs, 04 Apr 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - now produces a better coarse pixel plot
                            for altitude vs latitude or longitude
                            plots, even though the initial box size
                            is not exactly reproduced. 
 cdh, eml, phs, 24 Sep 2009: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - fixes for LOG10 plots
                          - new improved interpolation scheme in Z
                            direction
                          - C_LEVELS works with /SAMPLE
                          - added checks on NAN when looking at
                            min/max, added NAN_COLOR to specify a
                            color for NaN
                          - added BOTOUTOFRANGE to set color of data
                            below Min_Valid
                          - check if !MYCT is defined
 xyue & bmy, 24 Jan 2011: GAMAP VERSION 2.15
                          - Replace /ERASE keyword with /NOERASE
                            to facilitate manual positioning of
                            plots.  Pass /NOERASE to MULTIPANEL.
                            This is now consistent w/ TVMAP.
