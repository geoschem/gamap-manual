 NAME:
        CTM_EXTRACT (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Extracts a block of data from a 3-D CTM data cube.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_EXTRACT, DATA, MODELINFO, GRIDINFO [,Keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATA -> The data cube from which to extract a region.
             DATA must be 3-dimensional (e.g. lon-lat-alt, or 
             lon-lat-tracer, etc).

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MODELINFO -> The MODELINFO structure returned from function 
             CTM_TYPE.  

        GRIDINFO -> The GRIDINFO structure returned from function
             CTM_GRID.

        AVERAGE -> Bit flag indicating the dimensions over which to
             average the data:
                1 :  longitudinal
                2 :  latitudinal
                4 :  vertical
             These values can be combined. E.g., to average over 
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE 
             superseeds the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see below).
 
        TOTAL -> Bit flag indicating the dimensions over which
             to sum the data:
                1 :  longitudinal
                2 :  latitudinal
                4 :  vertical
             These values can be combined. E.g., to integrate over
             longitude and latitude use 3. A bit set in AVERAGE
             superseeds the corresponding bit in TOTAL (see above).

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as index 
             arrays.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as 
             ranges (i.e. two-element vectors containing min and max values).

        LAT -> An index array of latitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max latitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -90, 90 ].

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max sigma levels to be included
             in the extracted data block.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].

        LON -> An index array of longitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max longitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -180, 180 ].

        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude 
             values (or a scalar specifying a single altitude) to
             be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure levels 
             (or a scalar specifying a single pressure level) to be
             included in the extracted data block.

        WE -> Returns to the calling program the index array of longitudes 
             for the extracted data region, ordered from west to east.

        SN -> Returns to the calling program the index array of latitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from South to North.
 
        UP -> Returns to the calling program the index array of vertical  
             levels for the extracted data region, ordered from surface
             to top.

        DIM -> A named variable will return the new dimension information 
             of the data block after averaging or totaling.

        _EXTRA=e   -> Picks up extra keywords for CTM_INDEX.

 OUTPUTS:
        X, Y, Z -> Arrays of latitude, longitude, or altitude values 
             corresponding to the the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dimensions of 
             the DATA array, respectively.

 SUBROUTINES:
        CTM_INDEX 
        DEFAULT_RANGE (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses GAMAP package subroutines.

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_EXTRACT returns the extracted data region as 
        the function value.

        (2) Assumes a 3-D data cube as input, of dimensions (lon, lat,
        alt), or for some diagnostics (lon, lat, "tracer" number).

        (3) In the calling program, CTM_TYPE and CTM_GRID must be 
        called to compute the MODELINFO and GRIDINFO structures,
        which can then be passed to CTM_EXTRACT.

        (4) If any of the LAT, LON, LEV, ALTRANGE, PRANGE keywords are
        explicity specified, then CTM_EXTRACT will return to the
        calling program their original, unmodified values.  If any
        of these are not explicitly specified , then CTM_EXTRACT 
        will return to the calling program default values.  

 EXAMPLE:
        (1)
        MODELINFO  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        GRIDINFO   = CTM_GRID( MODELINFO )
        DATAREGION = CTM_EXTRACT( DATACUBE,                   $
                                  MODELINFO=MODELINFO,        $
                                  GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO           $
                                  LON=[-180,0], LAT=[-30,30], $ 
                                  LEV=[1,10] )

               ; Extracts from a GEOS-4 4x5 data cube a region 
               ; delimited by longitude = [-180, 0], 
               ; latitude = [-30, 30], for levels 1 to 10.

        (2)
        LON = INDGEN( 36 )
        LAT = INDGEN( 16 ) + 15
        LEV = INDGEN( 10 ) 
        MODELINFO  = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4' )
        GRIDINFO   = CTM_GRID( MODELINFO )
        DATAREGION = CTM_EXTRACT( DATACUBE,            $
                                  MODELINFO=MODELINFO, $
                                  GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO,   $
                                  /INDEX,  LON=LON,    $
                                  LAT=LAT, LEV=LEV )

               ; Extracts same data region as in Example (1) but 
               ; here passes explicit index arrays instead of ranges.

 NAME:
        CTM_GET_DATA

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve specific data records from CTM output files.
        Opening files, parsing header information, and loading
        of data are handled transparently and can be 
        controlled by various keywords. The routine returns a
        subset of the global DATAINFO structure that matches the
        requested category and (optional) tracer and time step(s).

        This routine should be called *whenever* you want to 
        access data and you are not sure that it has been 
        loaded previously. It provides the general user-interface
        for GAMAP (the Global Atmospheric Model output Analysis 
        Package). 

        For the future, a widget interface to this routine is 
        planned.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_GET_DATA, DATAINFO [,DIAGN] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name (see
             (CTM_DIAGINFO). A value of 0 (or an empty string)
             prompts processing of all available diagnostics.
             DIAGN can also be an array of diagnostic numbers or
             category names.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> (optional) If FILENAME is a fully qualified file path
             the specified file is opened without user interaction.
             If filename is empty or contains wildchards (*,?), a
             pickfile dialog will be displayed.
             If FILENAME is a named variable it will contain the full
             file path upon return so that a subsequent call to
             CTM_GET_DATA with the same FILENAME argument will not prompt
             another file selection dialog.
                If the FILENAME keyword is present, CTM_GET_DATA
             will restrict it's scope to records from the selected
             is file (even if FILENAME contains an empty string, it will 
             restrict the scope of the search!).
                If the file is found in the global FILEINFO structure or
             the USE_FILEINFO structure (i.e. it has been opened 
             previously), then it will not be parsed again; instead the
             data records are returned from memory.
                The data itself is loaded transparently via 
             CTM_RETRIEVE_DATA.

        ILUN -> An optional value or array of logical unit numbers. If
             given, the search is restricted to data from the specified
             files. Default is to use all files (unless the FILENAME
             keyword is present). If an undefined variable
             is passed into ILUN, information about all accessible files
             in the global FILEINFO structure (or USE_FILEINFO) is returned.

        TRACER -> A tracer ID number or a list of those. If given, the
             search is restricted to those tracers. Default is to use all 
             tracers. If an undefined variable is passed into TRACER, 
             and one specific diagnostics is requested with DIAGN,
             information about all accessible tracers in the global
             DATAINFO structure or USE_DATAINFO structure or the
             DATAINFO structure associated with a specific file is returned.

        TAU0 -> A time value or list of values to restrict the search.
             Default handling as with ILUN or TRACER. TAU0 superseeds
             /FIRST, /LAST or TAURANGE.

        TAURANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the first and last tau0
             value to look for. 

        /FIRST, /LAST -> extract first or last time step that is stored for
             the selected diagnostics, ilun, and tracer. Only one can be 
             be active at a time. /LAST superseeds /FIRST.

        INDEX -> A named variable that will contain the indices of the 
             records in USE_DATAINFO that match the selection criteria.
             You can test INDEX[0] ge 0 in order to see if CTM_GET_DATA has
             been successful although it is now recommended to test for
             n_elements(DATAINFO) eq 0. 
                The INDEX keyword is useful if you want to change the
             information contained in the selected DATAINFO structures
             globally.

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATA will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO must contain entries for all logical unit numbers
             that are used in USE_DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

        /INTERNAL_USE -> Set this keyword if you want to prevent a call
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE, but instead abort in case of undefined 
             (global) FILEINFO or DATAINFO structures.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> An array of DATAINFO records that match the selected 
             criteria. You can then simply loop over 
             0..n_elements(DATAINFO)-1 to access all data records and 
             extract the data as *(DATAINFO[i].data).
             DATAINFO will be undefined if no records are found!!
             Always test for  IF (n_elements(DATAINFO) eq 0) ... !
             NOTE: Alternatively you can return the INDEX to the selected
             data records in the global (or USE_) datainfo structure array
             with the INDEX keyword. This may in some cases eliminate the
             need to make a local copy of the selected DATAINFO records. 

 SUBROUTINES:
       pro reopen_all_files,fileinfo
       (needed in order to get free unit numbers)

       pro make_compound_datainfo,DataInfo,category,ilun,tracer,tau0,tau1
       (make compound structure for multilevel or multitracer diagnostics)

       pro update_tracer_datainfo,datainfo,traceroffset
       (enter tracer information into global datainfo structure)

 REQUIREMENTS:
       Several ctm_* routines are used
       Also uses UNDEFINE (by D. Fanning)

 NOTES:
       Please test rigorously. In case of read errors, try using CTM_OPEN_FILE
       with the /PRINT keyword.

       If your model output (ASCII punch file) does not contain the
       dimensional information about each data block, it may cause problems
       for diagnostics that do not contain 72x46 elements.
       It's defintively a good idea to implement this little change *NOW* !

       Outline of this procedure:
       - get all data records that match selection criteria
       - create "compound" datainfo structures for multilevel and
         multitracer diagnostics (those hold 3D data blocks)
       - read data for all selected compound structures unless only
         status information requested

        mgs, 19 Nov 1998: - bug fix with scale factor. Didn't get globally
                            updated because it was linked to unit. Need a
                            more generic global update procedure !
        mgs, 03 Dec 1998: - yet another bug fix in reopen files: needed

                          - Now reference function LITTLE_ENDIAN
                          - Swap endian in OPEN_FILE if reading data
                            on a little-endian machine (e.g. PC) 
        bmy, 19 Nov 2003: GAMAP VERSION 2.01
                          - now test valid diagnostics using 
                            DIAGSTRU[*].CATEGORY and not DIAGSTRU[*].INDEX
                          - removed /SMALLCHEM keyword, it's obsolete
                          - Now recognizes binary files as having
                            FILETYPE values between 100 and 200

                          - Internal routine MAKE_COMPOUND_DATAINFO
                            now passes SPACING from CTM_DIAGINFO
                            to routine CTM_DOSELECT_DATA
        bmy, 27 Oct 2004: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - added QUIET keyword to suppress printing
                            information about retrieved tracers
        bmy, 06 Feb 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - Bug fix: use DIALOG_PICKFILE to get file name
                            before calling CTM_OPEN_FILE.  This is necessary
                            because the tests for certain file types requires
                            the file name to be known ahead of time.
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10

                            CTM_OPEN_FILE. This allows to read nested 
                            met (GMAO) files by using /NA or /CHINA
  bmy & phs, 20 Nov 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.11
                          - If FILENAME is not defined, then the value
                            of the filename selected via dialog box
                            will be passed back to the calling program.

 KNOWN BUGS OR WEAKNESSES:
        - handling of USE_DATAINFO and USE_FILEINFO is not carried 
          through all lower level subroutines, i.e. they may be replaced
          by *pGlobal... in some occasions. Since USE_... should always
          be a subset of *pGlobal..., no serious errors are expected
          from this weakness. 

        - known bug in update_tracer_datainfo, see comment in routine.

 NAME:
        CTM_GET_DATABLOCK

 PURPOSE:
        Extracts a data block from a CTM punch file.
        (Wrapper program for CTM_GET_DATA and CTM_EXTRACT.)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        SUCCESS = CTM_GET_DATABLOCK(DATA [,DIAGN] [,Keywords])

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name (see
             (CTM_DIAGINFO). This must uniquely identify a
             specific data type.  DIAGN is passed to CTM_GET_DATA


 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
     Keywords that are passed to CTM_GET_DATA:
     =========================================
        FILENAME   -> Name of the file to open.  FILENAME is passed
                      to CTM_GET_DATA.  CTM_GET_DATA will return
                      the full path name, which is then returned
                      to the calling program.

        USE_FILEINFO -> (optional) If provided, CTM_GET_DATA will 
             restrict its search to only the files that are
             contained in USE_FILEINFO which must be a FILEINFO 
             structure array. Default is to use the global information 
             (see gamap_cmn.pro).
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_FILEINFO,
             it will either contain the global FILEINFO structure array 
             or the FILEINFO record of the specified file.
             USE_FILEINFO and USE_DATAINFO must be consistent, and should
             either both be used or omitted. However, it is
             possible to provide the global FILEINFO structure 
             (or nothing) with a local subset of DATAINFO.

        USE_DATAINFO -> (optional) Restrict search to records contained
             in USE_DATAINFO which must be a DATAINFO structure array. 
             If an undefined named variable is provided in USE_DATAINFO,
             it will either contain the global DATAINFO structure array 
             or all DATAINFO records of the specified file.
             See also USE_FILEINFO.

     Keywords that are passed to CTM_EXTRACT:
     ========================================
        AVERAGE -> Bit flag to average over certain dimensions
             (see CTM_EXTRACT)

        TOTAL -> Bit flag to sum over certain dimensions 
             (see CTM_EXTRACT)

        /INDEX -> If set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as index 
             arrays.  If not set, will interpret LAT, LEV, and LON as 
             ranges (i.e. two-element vectors containing min and max values).

        LAT -> An index array of latitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max latitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -90, 90 ].

        LEV -> An index array of sigma levels *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max sigma levels to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ 1, GRIDINFO.LMX ].

        LON -> An index array of longitudes *OR* a two-element vector 
             specifying the min and max longitudes to be included in
             the extracted data block.  Default is [ -180, 180 ].

        ALTRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max altitude
             values to be included in the extracted data block.

        PRANGE -> A vector specifying the min and max pressure levels 
             to be included in the extracted data block.

     Other keywords:
     ===============
        XMID, YMID, ZMID -> Arrays of values (e.g. latitude,
             longitude, or altitude) for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
             dimensions of the DATA array, respectively.  
             NOTE: These are *NOT* index arrays.

        THISDATAINFO -> Returns the DATAINFO structure for the
             selected data block.

        MODELINFO -> Returns to the calling program the model information 
             structure created by CTM_TYPE.
                      
        GRIDINFO -> Returns to the calling program the grid information  
             structure created by CTM_GRID.

        WE -> Returns to the calling program the index array of longitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from west to east.

        SN -> Returns to the calling program the index array of latitudes
             for the extracted data region, ordered from South to North 
 
        UP -> Returns to the calling program the index array of vertical
             levels for the extracted data region, ordered from surface 
             to top.

        PSURF -> Surface pressure to be used for the conversion from
             sigma layers to pressure and altitude.  For defaults 
             see function CTM_TYPE.

       _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATA
              and CTM_EXTRACT.
 
 OUTPUTS:
        SUCCESS -> Returns 1 if successful or 0 otherwise.
 
        DATA -> A 2D or 3D data array

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================
        CTM_GET_DATA
        CTM_GRID    (function)
        CTM_EXTRACT (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_GET_DATABLOCK returns the extracted data block as the 
        function value.

        (2) CTM_GET_DATABLOCK is meant to be called whenever you need
        to extract data from a punch file.  If the punch file needs
        to be opened, CTM_GET_DATABLOCK will do that automatically
        (via CTM_GET_DATA).  

 EXAMPLE:
   FILENAME  = '~/amalthea/CTM4/run/ctm.pch'
   LAT       = [  -90,  90 ]
   LON       = [ -180, 180 ]
   LEV       = 1
   SUCCESS   = CTM_GET_DATABLOCK( DATA, 'IJ-AVG-$',                 $
                           XIND=XMID, YIND=YMID, ZIND=ZMID,         $
                           THISDATAINFO=THISDATAINFO,               $
                           TRACER=1,           FILENAME=FILENAME,   $
                           GRIDINFO=GRIDINFO,  MODELINFO=MODELINFO, $
                           LEV=LEV,            LAT=LAT,             $
                           LON=LON,            WE=WE,               $
                           SN=SN,              UP=UP )

   IF ( NOT SUCCESS ) THEN RETURN, 0

            ; gets a data block for the IJ-AVG-$ (ND45) diagnostic,
            ; for the first tracer, at the first timestep, with the 
            ; given latitude, longitude, and sigma level ranges.  
            ; Returns FILEINFO, DATAINFO, THISDATAINFO, WE, SN, UP, 
            ; XMID, YMID, and ZMID to the calling program.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 16 Sep 1998: VERSION 1.00
        bmy, 17 Sep 1998: - added FILENAME keyword, so that the file
                            name can be passed back to the calling
                            program. 
        bmy, 18 Sep 1998: VERSION 1.01
                          - now compatible with CTM_EXTRACT v. 1.01
                          - INDEX, SN, WE, UP keywords added
                          - LATRANGE, LONRANGE, LEVRANGE renamed
                            to LAT, LON, LEV (since they may now 
                            contain arrays and not just ranges).

 NAME:
        CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Create a datainfo and fileinfo structure from an
        "external" data set so that it can be used seamlessly
        within the GAMAP package. The dataset can have up to
        four dimensions (however, only the first 3 are currently
        supported). The new datainfo and fileinfo structures 
        will be added to the global structure arrays.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO( DATA, DATAINFO, FILEINFO  [,Keywords] )

 INPUTS:
        DATA  -> A 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D data array.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostics name (category) or number that describes
               the data type. If not given, the user will be prompted.
               If DIAGN is a number that is not recognized as valid
               diagnostics by CTM_DIAGINFO, the number will be stored
               as string value. If DIAGN is a string, it does not have 
               to be a valid diagnostics category.

        DIM -> A 4 element vector with the DATA dimensions as
               LON, LAT, LEVEL, TIME. If not given, the dimensions
               of DATA will be entered sequentially. Use this keyword
               to properly identify e.g. a zonal mean data set as
               DIM = [ 0, 46, 20, 0 ] (for the GEOS-1).
               The order and magnitude of the dimensions in DIM must
               agree with the dimensions of the DATA array
               (e.g. if DATA(72,46) then DIM=[46,72,0,0] is not allowed).

        FILENAME-> Name of the file which is specified by the
               FILEINFO structure.  If FILENAME is not specified, 
               then the default FILENAME = "derived data".

        FILETYPE -> A numeric code to identify the file type.  If not
               specified then the default FILETYPE = -1.

        FIRSTBOX -> A 3 element vector containing IFIRST, JFIRST, and
               LFIRST, which are the starting indices for the LON,
               LAT, and LEVEL dimensions.  

        FORMAT -> A format string (for ASCII data) or descriptive
               string (for binary or self-describing data) that is
               saved to the DATAINFO structure.  Default is ''.

        GRIDINFO -> A gridinfo structure describing the grid set-up
               of the data set (see CTM_GRID). If not given, 
               CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO attempts to use the MODELINFO 
               structure to construct GRIDINFO.

        ILUN -> The file unit number that will be used to identify 
               FILEINFO and DATAINFO.  If not passed, then ILUN will
               be negative to denote derived data, and will increment
               negatively for each data block, starting at -1. 

        MODELINFO -> A modelinfo structure containing information
               about the model that generated the data (see CTM_TYPE).
               If not given, the user is prompted for a selection.

        /NO_GLOBAL -> If passed, will prevent the DATAINFO and FILEINFO
               structures from being appended to the global GAMAP
               common blocks.  Useful for saving memory.

        /NO_VERTICAL (passed via _EXTRA) -> set this keyword if you only want
               to create a 2D gridfinfo structure.

        TAU0, TAU1 -> Beginning and end of time interval that is spanned
               by DATA (as TAU value). Default is -1 for both.

        TOPTITLE -> A user defined string that may describe the data set
               in more detail.

        TRACER -> A tracer number or name that identifies the chemical 
               species or physical quantity contained in DATA. If 
               TRACER is an invalid name, it will be set to -1, and the
               string value of TRACER will be used as TRCNAME (see below). 
               If not given, the user will be prompted.

        TRCNAME -> A tracer name. Default is to use the name associated
               with that tracer number in CTM_TRACERINFO.

        SCALE -> A value that is entered in the SCALE field in DATAINFO.
               Default is 1.0.

        UNIT -> A unit string. Default is empty.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATAINFO, FILEINFO -> The datainfo and fileinfo structures
               generated from the "external" data array. These are 
               automatically appended to the global DATAINFO and FILEINFO 
               structures, unless the /NO_GLOBAL keyword is set.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =========================================
        CREATE3DHSTRU, CREATE3DFSTRU, TAU2YYMMDD

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        In the current version, no error checking is made whether the
        DATA dimensions agree with the grid information. This is the
        users responsibility.

 NAME:
        CTM_NOYBUDGET

 PURPOSE:
        Computes the NOy budget within a given 3-D region.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_NOYBUDGET [, BATCHFILE [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        BATCHFILE (optional) -> Name of the batch file which 
             contains inputs that defines the 3-D region and NOy
             constituents.  If BATCHFILE is omitted, then the user
             will be prompted to supply a file name via a dialog box.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LOGFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the log file where output 
             will be sent.  Default is "noy_budget.log".

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:

        CTM_Get_Datablock (function)  CTM_BoxSize (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) CTM_NOYBUDGET was developed for use with the GEOS-CTM,
            there might be some adaptation required for use with
            other models.

        (2) Only 5 "families" are considered: 
            Dry Deposition, NOx, PAN, HNO3, R4N2.

        (3) Wrapping around the date line seems to work but you
            should always double-check.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_NOYBUDGET, 'box1.dat', LogFileName='box1.log'
           
             ; Computes NOy budgets for the region specified in

 NAME:
        CTM_PRINTDIFF

 PURPOSE:
        Prints the sum of the differences between two CTM
        output files.  This is a quick way of ensuring that
        two model versions are producing identical results.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PRINTDIFF, DIAGN [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category to restrict
             the record selection (default is: "IJ-AVG-$").        

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILE1 -> Name of the first CTM output file (the "old" file).
             If FILE1 is not given, or if it contains wildcard 
             characters (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted 
             to supply a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        FILE2 ->  Name of the second CTM output file (the "new" file).  
             If FILE2 is not given, or if it contains wildcard 
             characters (e.g. "*"), then the user will be prompted 
             to supply a file name via a pickfile dialog box.

        TRACER -> Number of the tracer for which differences
             will be plotted.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up other keywords for CTM_GET_DATABLOCK.

 OUTPUTS:
        Prints the quantity:

             DIFF[L] = TOTAL( DATA2[*,*,L] - DATA1[*,*,L] ) 

        for each level L.  If DIFF[L] = 0 for all levels L, then
        FILE1 and FILE2 contain identical data.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================
        CTM_CLEANUP
        CTM_GET_DATABLOCK (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) If DATA1 corresponds to the "old" data, and DATA2
            corresponds to the "new" data, then CTM_DIFF will 
            compute the following:
         
            Abs. Diff = ( new - old )

        (2) CTM_PRINTDIFF calls CTM_CLEANUP each time to remove
            previously read datablock info from the GAMAP common
            block.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILE1 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-30'      ; the "old" file
        FILE2 = 'ctm.bpch.v4-31'      ; the "new" file
        CTM_PRINTDIFF, 'IJ-AVG-$', $
             FILE1=FILE1, FILE2=FILE2, TRACER=1

        IDL prints:

 NAME:
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO

 PURPOSE:
        Create and print a formatted list of DATAINFO records.
        This procedure can be used for direct printing, but it
        can also return a string array of the formatted output 
        e.g. for use in a widget list.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO,DATAINFO [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> One or more DATAINFO records, e.g. the result 
             from CTM_GET_DATA.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FIELDS -> (*** not yet implemented ***) A list of fields
             (structure tag names) to be printed. Default is
             CATEGORY, ILUN, TRACERNAME, TRACERNUMBER, 
             UNIT, TAU0, STATUS, DIMENSIONS
             FIELDS can also include tags from the (global) FILEINFO
             structure (e.g. FILENAME).

        OUTPUT -> A named variable that will contain a string array
             with the formatted output including the title line but 
             without the seperating lines. The title is not included
             if keyword /NOTITLE is set.

        /NOPRINT -> Don't print, only return formatted strings

        /NOTITLE -> Do not generate title line (will neither be printed
             nor included in OUTPUT.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External subroutines required:  
        ------------------------------
        GAMAP_CMN  (include file)
        TAU2YYMMDD (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        For GISS, FSU family of models, TAU0 = 0 occurs on date 1/1/1980.
        For GEOS      family of models, TAU0 = 0 occurs on date 1/1/1985.
        Therefore, the model family must be obtained from the global
        FILEINFO structure in order to display the YYMMDD
        corresponding to TAU0.
 
 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_GET_DATA,DataInfo,File='',tracer=2
        CTM_PRINT_DATAINFO,DataInfo
        ; *or*

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT

 PURPOSE:
        Reads GEOS-CHEM plane flight diagnostic (ND40) data.  

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT( FILENAME )

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file containing data from the GEOS-CHEM
             plane following diagnostic ND40.  If FILENAME is omitted,
             then a dialog box will prompt the user to supply a file name.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Array of structures containing data from read from
             the input file.  Each different plane type will have 
             a structure in RESULT containing the following tags:
 
             NPOINTS  : Number of points read from the file 
             NVARS    : Number of variables read from the file
             PLATFORM : Name of plane type (e.g. DC8, P3B, FALCON)
             DATE     : Array w/ YYYYMMDD  at each flight point [GMT date]
             TIME     : Array w  HHMM      at each flight point [GMT time]
             LAT      : Array w/ latitude  at each flight point [degrees ]
             LON      : Array w/ longitude at each flight point [degrees ]   
             PRESS    : Array w/ pressure  at each flight point [hPa     ]
             VARNAMES : Array w/ names of each variable 
             DATA     : Array w/ data for each variable

 NOTES:
        We read the data into arrays first, and then save the arrays
        into an IDL structure.  If you read the data into an array of
        structures, this executes much more slowly.  Also arrays of
        structures seem to suck up an inordinate amount of memory.

 EXAMPLES:
        PLANEINFO = CTM_READ_PLANEFLIGHT( 'plane.log.20040601' )
             ; Reads data from file into the PLANEINFO structure

        DC8 = WHERE( PLANEINFO[*].PLATFORM eq 'DC801' )
             ; Look for DC8 data

        PRINT, PLANEINFO[DC8].LAT[*]
        PRINT, PLANEINFO[DC8].LON[*]
             ; Prints latitudes and longitudes of DC8 to the screen

        IND = WHERE( PLANEINFO[DC8].VARNAMES eq 'TRA_004' )
        CO  = PLANEINFO[DC8].DATA[ *, IND ]
             ; Extracts CO (tracer #4 in a GEOS-CHEM fullchem
             ; simulation) to an array

        IND  = WHERE( PLANEINFO[DC8].VARNAMES eq 'GMAO_UWND' )
        UWND = PLANEINFO[DC8].DATA[ *, IND ]
             ; Extracts U-wind information to an array

 NAME:
        CTM_SELECT_DATA (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Provide a user-friendly function to extract data
        from a DATAINFO structure. The function returns an 
        index to the given DATAINFO structure which points
        to all recored that fulfill the specified conditions.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Internals, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(DIAGN[,DATAINFO,keywords])

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic number or category name. Only one
            diagnostic can be extracted at the same time. Complete
            information about the requested diagnostic is returned 
            via the DIAGSTRU keyword. (see also CTM_DIAGINFO)

        DATAINFO -> An [optional] subset of the global DataInfo
            structure. As default, CTM_SELECT_DATA operates on
            the global DATAINFO structure (see gamap_cmn.pro) scanning
            all files that have been opened.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        ILUN -> A logical unit value or an array of logical unit
            values. Only recored from these files will be returned.
            Default is to use all files.
            A link between logical unit numbers and filenames can be
            made through the (global) FileInfo structure (see gamap_cmn.pro)

        TRACER -> A tracer number or an array of tracer numbers to
            restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all tracers. 
            Tracer numbers less than 100 are automatically expanded
            to include the offset of certain diagnostics (see
            CTM_DIAGINFO and CTM_DOSELECT_DATA).

        TAU -> A time value (tau0 !) or an array of time values
            to restrict the selection of data records. Default is to
            return information about all time steps. (see also example)

        LEVELRANGE -> A 1 or 2 element vector with a level index or 
            a range of level indices for multilevel diagnostics
            (e.g. 'IJ-AVG$'). As default, information is returned
            about full 3D data blocks only. See also 
            EXPAND keyword.

        /EXPAND -> If set, multilevel diagnostic fields are
            expanded to return the individual layers in addition to
            the complete 3D cube.
        
        DATA -> A named variable that will contain an array with
            pointers to the indexed data blocks. Note that some may
            be NIL pointers if the STATUS value is 0 or 2.

        COUNT -> A named variable that will return the number of
            data blocks found with the given selection criteria
 
        DIAGSTRU -> A named variable that will contain complete 
            information about the requested diagnostics (see
            CTM_DIAGINFO)

        STATUS -> Restricts the data selection to
            Data that has not been read  (STATUS = 0)
            Data that has been read      (STATUS = 1, default)
            All data blocks              (STATUS = 2)
            If STATUS is 1, all pointers returned in DATA are valid.

 OUTPUTS:
        The function returns an (long) integer array that contains
        index values to all the data blocks that match the selection 
        criteria. If no data is found, -1 is returned.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses CTM_DOSELECT_DATA, EXPAND_CATEGORY, gamap_cmn.pro,
             GAMAP_INIT, CTM_DIAGINFO

 NOTES:
        This function acts for the most part as a convenient user
        interface to CTM_DOSELECT_DATA which performs the actual
        selection process and contains only minimal error checking.
        For programming purposes, use CTM_DOSELECT_DATA when possible.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; open a CTM punch file
        CTM_OPEN_FILE

        ; Read diagnostic number 45 for all tracers and time steps
        CTM_READ_DATA,45

        ; Select data for tracer 1 and diagnostics 45 
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(45,tracer=1,data=pdata)

        ; De-reference the data pointer for the first record
        ; (usually the first timestep)
        if (index[0] ge 0) then data = (*pdata)[0] 

        ; find data for a specific time range
        DataInfo = (*pGlobalDataInfo)[index]
        taus = where(DataInfo.tau0 ge 77666L AND DataInfo.tau1 le 78888L)
        taus = DataInfo.tau0[taus]
        index = CTM_SELECT_DATA(45,DataInfo,tracer=1,tau=taus,data=pdata)

 NAME:
        CTM_SUM

 PURPOSE:
        Calculate the sum of several CTM output data blocks
        and store them in a new datainfo structure as "derived 
        data".  The user can select data blocks by diagnostics,
        tracer, tau0, or logical unit of the source file.  With 
        the AVERAGE keyword averages will be computed instead of
        totals.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_SUM [, DIAGN ] [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> The diagnostic category name.  Default is 'IJ-AVG-$'

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) to look for.

        TAU0 -> beginning of time step to look for. You can
            specify a date using function nymd2tau(YYMMDD,HHMMSS)

        ILUN -> If you want to restrict summation to datablocks from
            one particular file, set the ILUN keyword to the 
            respective logical unit number.  ILUN and FILENAME are
            mutually exclusive.  If you select FILENAME then ILUN 
            will be ignored.

        FILENAME -> Instead of ILUN you may pass the name of a
            CTM data file containing data blocks to be summed.
            FILENAME and ILUN are mutually exclusive.  If you 
            select FILENAME then ILUN will be ignored.

        NEWTRACER -> Tracer number for the new tracer. Default is 
            to use the same number as the tracer in the first 
            selected data block.

        NEWTAU0 -> A new pair of values for the time stamp. Default 
            is to use the minimum tau0 and maximum tau1 from the 
            selected data blocks. If only one value is passed (tau0),
            then tau1 will be set to tau0+1.

        /AVERAGE -> set this keyword to compute a (simple) average
            instead of the total.

 OUTPUTS:
        This routne produces no output but stores a new datainfo 
        and fileinfo structure into the global arrays.

 SUBROUTINES:
        uses gamap_cmn, ctm_get_data, ctm_grid, and ctm_make_datainfo

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        All data blocks must originate from compatible models.
        No test can be made whether an identical addition had been
        performed earlier. Hence, it is a good idea to test the
        existence of the "target" record before in order to avoid 
        duplicates.

 EXAMPLE:
        (1) 
        CTM_GET_DATA, DATAINFO, 'IJ-AVG-$', $
          TRACER=1, TAU0=NYMD2TAU( 940301L )

        IF (N_ELEMENTS(DATAINFO) EQ 0) THEN $
           CTM_SUM, 'IJ-AVG-$', TRACER=[1,2,3,4,5],  $
              TAU0=NYMD2TAU(940301L), NEWTRACER=1

           ; Add individual CH3I tracers for 03/01/1994 and 
           ; store them  as total CH3I concentration. 
           ; But first: test!

        (2)
        CTM_SUM,'IJ-AVG-$',$
           TRACER=2, FILENAME='ctm.bpch.ox', /AVERAGE 
        
           ; Compute annual averages from monthly means for Ox

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Added FILENAME keyword as an 
                            alternative to ILUN
                          - Updated comments, cosmetic changes
        phs, 18 Aug 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.13
                          - Added experimental keyword DIMAVER to
                            average along any dimension of the
                            datablocks.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS, DIAGN [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name to restrict 
             the record selection (default is "ANTHSRCE").

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Punch file (ASCII or Binary) from which to 
             read CTM emissions data.  If omitted, the user
             will be prompted to select a file via a dialog box.

        FORMAT -> To overwrite the default format to output the
             sum.

        TRACER -> The tracer number (or a 1-D array of tracer
             numbers) to compute emission totals for.

        /CUM_ONLY -> If this switch is set, SUM_EMISSIONS will
             only print out cumuluative totals (and skip individual
             totals for each data block).

        RESULT -> An array of structures (tag names: NAME, SUM, UNIT) 
             that returns, the name of each tracer, its cumulative
             total, and its unit to the calling program.
           
        /NO_SECONDS -> Set this switch if the data to be summed is
             independent of seconds (e.g. molec/cm2).  CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS
             will not multiply the data by the number of seconds in the 
             interval when converting to Tg.

        /KG -> Set this switch if the data to be summed is in kg
             instead of molec/cm2 or molec/cm2/s.  CTM_SUM_EMISSIONS
             will not multiply the data by the surface area of each
             grid box when converting to Tg.

        /TO_Mg -> Set this switch if you wish to display emissions
             totals in Mg instead of Tg.

        /TO_Gg -> Set this switch if you wish to display emissions
             totals in Gg instead of Tg.

        /SHORT -> Use a shorter output format to print totals.
             Default is to print out w/ the long output format.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up any extra keywords for CTM_GET_DATA
             or CTM_TRACERINFO.
 
 OUTPUTS:
        Prints totals in Tg or Tg C for each tracer to the screen

 SUBROUTINES:

        TAU2YYMMDD  (function)  UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Most of the time there will be 1 data block per month,
            and the cumulative total will be a yearly total.

        (2) For NOx, a molecular weight of 14e-3 kg/mole will report
            results in Tg N.  A molecular weight of 46e-3 will report
            results in Tg NOx.  This can be changed in the file
            "tracerinfo.dat".

        (3) Should now be compatible with any model type and grid
            resolution.  As of 6/19/01, has only been tested using
            GEOS-CHEM diagnostic output.

 NAME:
        CTM_TRACERINFO

 PURPOSE:
        Return information about one or all tracers for a given
        GEOS-Chem, GISS, or other CTM diagnostic.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Structures

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_TRACERINFO, TRACERN, TRACERSTRU [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        TRACERN -> Tracer number or name for which to extract the 
            information. If TRACERN is numeric, it is interpreted as 
            an index to the FULLCHEM or SMALLCHEM tracernumber
            in the global model. If it is a string, it will be compared 
            to NAME then FULLNAME. TRACERN may contain more than one 
            element. To retrieve information about all tracers, use the
            /ALL_TRACERS keyword.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /ALL_TRACERS -> Retrieve information about all tracers

        FILENAME --> Name of the tracerinfo file (default tracerinfo.dat)
            The file will be searched in the current directory first, then
            in the directory where ctm_tracerinfo.pro is located. If not found
            in either location, a standard data block is retrieved from this 
            file.

        /FORCE_READING -> Overwrite the contents of the common block

        FULLNAME -> Returns the (long) name of the requested tracer(s)

        INDEX -> Returns the CTM index of the requested tracer(s)

        MOLC -> Returns the carbon number of the requested tracer(s)
             (For hydrocarbons, this is the # moles C/mole tracer)

        MOLWT -> Returns the molecular weight (kg/mole) of the 
             requested tracer(s)

        NAME -> Returns the (short) name of the requested tracer(s)

        SCALE -> Standard scale factor for tracer

        UNIT -> Returns the standard unit of the requested tracer(s)
             (i.e. unit as supplied by CTM with standard scale factor 
             applied (e.g. ppbv instead of V/V))

        IS_EDGED -> Returns whether the given tracer is defined on
             level edges (IS_EDGED=1) or level centers (IS_EDGED=0).  

 OUTPUTS:
        TRACERSTRU -> returns a structure or structure array with the 
            following tags:
               NAME     : short name for tracer as used in the model
               FULLNAME : long name for tracer (may be used in titles)
               MWT      : molec. weight as kg N or kg C 
               INDEX    : tracer number
               MOLC     : carbon number for NMHC
               SCALE    : standard scale factor
               UNIT     : standard unit for tracer with scale factor applied
               IS_EDGED : Is tracer defined on level edges?

 SUBROUTINES:

        FILE_EXIST (function)   ROUTINE_NAME (function)
        OPEN_FILE 
 
 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        At first call, the tracer information structure array is
        either read from file or retrieved from the
        DATA block at the end of this program. Thereafter, the information
        is stored in a common block where it is accessible in subsequent 
        calls.
        The newer tags MOLC, SCALE and UNIT are optional and defaulted
        to 1.0, 1.0, and 'UNDEFINED', resp.

 EXAMPLE:
        CTM_TRACERINFO, 2, RES
        PRINT, RES.NAME, RES.MWT, RES.INDEX
        ; prints        Ox    0.0480000     2

        CTM_TRACERINFO,'OX',RES
        PRINT, RES.NAME, RES.MWT, RES.INDEX
        ; prints identical results

        CTM_TRACERINFO,[1,3,5],NAME=NAME,MOLWT=MWT,MOLC=MOLC,/FORCE_READING
        PRINT, NAME, MWT, MOLC
        ; reads tracerinfo.dat file and prints

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from the Geos-CHEM ND48
        diagnostics contained in one or more binary punch files.

        The goal is to combine, for one station, all the data blocks
        (there is one per time step) into one single 4-D data block
        (we want the time to be the 4th dimension). This is basically
        to take advantage of support for 4D dataset in GAMAP v2-10.

        GEOS-Chem ND48 (as in v7-04-12) outputs one file for all
        stations and all time steps. GC_COMBINE_ND48 will write one
        file but each timeseries will be in one data block instead of
        as many as the number of timesteps. This will make reading
        the timeseries with CTM_GET_DATA a lot faster.

        Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        applied: moving average and/or daily maximum.

        LIMITATION: daily maximum will not make sense if series do
        not cover full days.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Time Series

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GC_COMBINE_ND48 [, Keywords ]

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

        By defaults all stations are processed. And one output file
        is created that contains all the stations timeseries.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        INFILE -> one or more station file(s) from ND48
              diagnostic. If more than one file is processed, it is
              assumed that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they
              are in chronological order (this is automatically the
              case, if you insert YYYYMMDD into ND48 filenames in
              input.geos).

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for "stations" files. Can be
             either input or output keyword:

             Input: when defined, ALL files satisfying the MASK
                    keyword in the directory will be selected.

             Ouput: set to a variable name that will contains the DIR
                    of the selected files.

             It is ignored (both input and output roles) if INFILE is
             provided.

             If neither INFILE nor INDIR is set, then a dialog window
             that allows multiple files selection (keep CTRL or SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up.


        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "stations*".

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             new timeseries. Default is 'combined'+INFILE[0], in the
             same directory as stations file. If the full path is not
             included, the file is created in the working directory.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;================= Data Selection ======================

        STATIONNB -> Station(s) number. Can be one or more elements
              (up to the number of stations in ND48). Use to select a
              subset of the stations instead of all of them.

        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data is selected.

              If min and/or max of TIME is outside the range of
              available time steps, the first or last available time
              step is used.

              Note 1: this is also an output keyword. Then, if passed
              by reference, TIME becomes the time vector in
              output. See example (6).

              Note 2: if using DMAX or DAVG, then TIME should be long 
              integer (YYYYMMDD), if not it should be Tau format.

        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NAN,
              EDGE_TRUNCATE, and MISSING).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average. (Local time is not accounted for: days start
              and end at 0 UT everywhere).

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average. (Local time is not accounted for: days
              start and end at 0 UT everywhere).


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        All the following keywords will apply to only ONE
        station. The last one is used if none or more than one is
        requested.

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (1,1,lev,time) even though only one station is
             selected.

        LON -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             longitude of the data set on exit.

        LAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the
             latitude of the data set on exit.

        LEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of levels for the data set on exit.

        TIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector for the station on exit. Given as Tau values,
             unless DMAX or DAVG is set, then as YYYYMMDD.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, the TIME vector is in local time
             instead of UT. Has no effect if /DMAX or /DAVG.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. particularly useful to double check
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.

 NAME:
        GC_COMBINE_ND49

 PURPOSE:
        Combine timeseries data from several bpch files into 4D
        data. Typically used with Geos-CHEM ND49 timeseries output
        and met fields in bpch files (a3, a6, i6). 
        
        For met fields, see example (9) and (10).

        Each ND49 and Met Fields file has data for one day. But,
        files with time series that do no cover a day per file, can
        also be processed. See example (11), but keep in mind that
        the daily max or average options are then **** MEANINGLESS
        ****, and should not be used.


        WHAT IS DONE:
        
        (1) We combine all the data blocks for one tracer (there is
        one per time step) into one single 4-D data block (with time
        in 4th dimension). This takes advantage of support for 4D
        dataset introduced in GAMAP v2-10.

        (2) The combined series can be saved into a binary punch
        file. You end up with one file per tracer that covers many
        days of output, instead of one file per day for all
        tracers. The space saving can be more than 60%.

        (3) A subarea (even a single location) can be extracted. But
        for multiple but not contiguous locations, call the routine
        as many time as needed.

        (4) Shorter timeseries can be selected/saved, by specifying
        Tau range, or day (as YYYYMMDD long integer) range if daily
        max or average is selected.

        (5) Two basic signal processing before saving the data can be
        performed: moving average and/or daily
        maximum/minimum/average.

        ## LIMITATION ## : full days considered for ND49, ie,
        GEOS-Chem runs should start and end at midnight (YYYYMMDD
        000000 in input.geos)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, Time Series

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        GC_COMBINE_ND49 [, TRACER ][, CATEGORY ][, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        TRACER -> The tracer number. Default is 1.

        CATEGORY -> The category name (default is "IJ-AVG-$")
             for which to read data.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

        ;============ For I/O files/directory =====================

        FILELIST -> list of files to process. Usually used as output
             keyword to get the list of files selected with INDIR and
             MASK or through a dialog window.
             Can be used as input. Then INDIR and MASK are ignored.

        INDIR -> Directory where to look for MASK files.  If
             provided, ALL files satisfying the MASK keyword in the
             directory will be selected. If not provided, a dialog
             window that allows multiple files selection (keep SHIFT
             key down) will pop-up. See EXAMPLES below for tips.

             If set to an undefined variable name, it will hold the
             directory of the selected files (output keyword).

             NOTE: If more than one file is processed, it is assumed
             that, once sorted in alphabetical order, they are in
             chronological order (this is the case with GEOS-Chem
             default naming of ND49 output files: they contain
             YYYYMMDD).

        MASK -> Pattern Mask to find files in INDIR. Default is
             "ts*.bpch".

        OUTDIR -> Output directory where to save the file with the
             new timeseries data set will be. Default is INDIR. If
             the user has not write permission in INDIR, writintg is
             cancelled.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file that will contain the
             timeseries. Default is 'combts_%TRACERNAME%.bpch', for
             COMB ined  T ime  S eries.

            The routine prevents from overwriting any input file.

        ;============ To extract subset of data ===================

        LON -> A one or two-elements vector specifying the longitude
            of one location or one area. If LON is outside the ND49
            area, the program print a warning, and uses border
            value.

        LAT -> same as LON, but for Latitudes

        LEV -> same as LON, but for Levels. Refers to the model grid.


        ; - - you can also select indices into the requested 3D cube:

        LLEV -> A one or two-element vector specifying the min and
             max of available levels to be included in the file.
             Default is ALL available levels.
             Default FORTRAN indexing is used: LLEV #1 is the first
             level ***requested*** in ND49. See LEV above otherwise.

        ILON, JLAT -> same as LLEV but for Longitude and Latitude
             indices. Starting at 1 at the first ***requested***
             grid box in ND49.


        TIME -> vector for selecting time span. The data covering
              [min(TIME),max(TIME)] are selected. If only one
              element, then the closest-in-time data are selected.
              TIME must be given as Tau (double) or YYYYMMDD (long)
              if /DMAX or /DAVG.
              If both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME are set, TIME is
              ignored. 

          ** TIP ** if you select a short time span, it may be
                    useful to limit the number of files to process
                    by redefining MASK or using FILELIST. That will
                    speed up the process.


        ;================= Signal Processing ======================

        MAVG -> to apply a running average filter to the series. MAVG
              value will define the boxcar size and must be GE
              3. Even numbers are increased by +1. The IDL SMOOTH
              routine is called and accept _extra keywords (NaN,
              Edge_truncate, missing).

        DMAX -> to select the daily maxima of the time series. If
              both MAVG and Dmax are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily max of the moving
              average.

        DAVG -> to select the daily average of the time series. If
              both MAVG and DAVG are set, the moving average is
              performed first and you get the daily average of the
              moving average.

        LOCALTIME -> to get DAVG or DMAX computed over local days
              instead of UT days. See details below.


        ;================= Output keywords ========================

        DATA -> set to a variable name that will hold the selected
             timeseries data on exit. This is a 4D array
             (nLon, nLat, nLevel, ntime) even if only one location is
             selected.

        OUTLON -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of longitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLAT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of latitudes of the data set on exit.

        OUTLEV -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of Levels of the data set on exit.

        OUTALT -> set to a variable name that will hold the vector
             of altitudes for the data set on exit.

        OUTTIME -> set to a variable name that will hold the time
             vector corresponding to the data set on exit. Format
             is Tau, or YYYYMMDD if /DMAX.

        LOCALTIME -> if set, OUTTIME becomes a Nb_OutLon X Nb_TimeStep
             array, with each vector OUTTIME[i,*] holding the time
             vector in local time instead of UT. That vector will
             apply to all j and k for DATA[i,j,k,*].


           Specific case of...  both DMAX (or DAVG) and LOCALTIME
             being set. The daily max (average) is obtained after
             shifting the timeseries, so they start at 00 LT
             everywhere (or the first available time step just before
             00 LT). The first max (average) value is for the first
             complete local day of the series. The OUTTIME array is
             then a [numbers of complete days, 2] array that gives
             the local YYYYMMDD for both positive and negative
             longitudes.

             See also note about TAU0/TAU1 below.

             Note that the time step of the series must be small
             enough for the DMAX/DAVG w/r/t Local Time to be
             reliable.


        ;================= Others ========================

        NOSAVE -> set to not save output into a BPCH file. Useful if
             you just want to check results with output keywords.

        VERBOSE -> Set to print informational message about the time
             series. Particularly useful to double check the
             area/location selected with subset keywords.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords for SMOOTH and
                 DIALOG_PICKFILE.


 OUTPUTS:
        See output keywords above.

 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References many routines from GAMAP package. Requires GAMAP
        v2.10 for saving 4D dataset into binary punch file.

 NOTES:
        ######## ND49 and Met Fields only. For ND48, see  ########
        ######## GC_COMBINE_ND48 (not as well maintained) ########

        Written with batch processing in mind. It is recommended to
        save all ND49 outputs into one dedicated directory, and to
        use keywords (INDIR, OUTDIR, OUTFILE..) and save the new
        combined timeseries in a new directory.

        About TAU0 and TAU1 : in the DataInfo structure, they are set
        to the beginning and end of the timeseries. For daily data,
        we compute them by setting HH:MM:SS to 00:00:00. If LocalTime
        is set, UT is still used for TAU0 and TAU1, so we can use
        only one value. If both LocalTime and DMAX are set, tau0 and
        tau1 give the first and last (local) days for longitudes less
        than 0 (west). For East longitudes, you need to add one day
        to these to get the correct date.

 NAME:
        GET_IS_EDGED  (function)

 PURPOSE:
        Determine if a GEOS-5 data field is defined on the
        vertical grid box edges or centers.

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = GET_IS_EDGED( NAME )

 INPUTS:
        NAME -> Name of the tracer or met field to be tested.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> Returns 1 if the tracer or met field specified by
             NAME is defined on grid box vertical edges, or 0
             otherwise.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) This is currently a KLUDGE.  Figure out a more 
            robust way of determining if fields are defined on 
            level edges or level centers later on. (bmy, 7/16/07)

        (2) Add more names to the CASE statement as necessary.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        PRINT, GET_IS_EDGED( 'PEDGE' )
          1
             ; The GEOS-5 PEDGE field is defined on the vertical
             ; grid edges, so GET_IS_EDGED returns 1.

        (2)
        PRINT, GET_IS_EDGED( 'UWND' )
          0

             ; The GEOS-5 UWND field is defined on the vertical
             ; grid centers, so GET_IS_EDGED returns 0.

 NAME:
        TSDIAG

 PURPOSE:
        Reads and plots CTM time series (station) data. The
        data are returned in a structure together with longitude,
        latitude, altitude, and time information. TSDIAG tries to
        construct a time vector from the TAU information stored
        in the file. This may not always work (e.. it is assumed 
        that time steps are 1 hour).
           While reading, TSDIAG displays a '.' for each new station
        encountered, and a '+' if a station is continued. If you want 
        more detailed output, set the /VERBOSE flag.

        %%% NOTE: May need updating %%%

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, GAMAP Data Manipulation, GAMAP Plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TSDIAG [,RESULT] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME    -> Path of the input file containing CTM 
                       Data data.

        SCALE -> A global scale factor that will be applied to all
                 data. Default is 1. Note that concentration data is
                 stored as v/v, hence for ppt you should set 
                 SCALE=1.E-12.

        /VERBOSE -> display detailed information on what is being read.
                 
        /PLOT -> set this flag to produce quick-and-dirty plots of the 
                 time-series data.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> A structure containing LON, LAT, ALT and Data data
               together with TRACER and a "global" TIME array.

 SUBROUTINES:
        OPEN_DEVICE               CLOSE_DEVICE
        CTM_TRACERINFO            FILE_EXIST (function)
        STRSCINOT (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:

 NOTES:
        Lines with the Data data (Header = 'TB' or 'DV') will be
        read from disk.  Statistics are ignored for now.

 EXAMPLE:
        ; read time series data from file and return result structure
