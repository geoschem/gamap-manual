 NAME:
        BPCH2ASCII

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch file v. 2.0 
        format to a simple ASCII file format
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2ASCII, INFILE, OUTFILE [ , Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the ASCII file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2ASCII will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII format to OUTFILE.

        /VERBOSE -> If set, then BPCH2ASCII will also echo the
             header lines for each data block to the screen.

        FORMAT -> String containing the numeric format for
             for the data values.  Default is '(7(e13.6,1x))'

 OUTPUTS:
         None

 SUBROUTINES:
         External Subroutines Required:
         =============================================
         CTM_GET_DATA         TAU2YYMMDD    (function)
         GETMODELANDGRIDINFO  REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
         UNDEFINE

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2ASCII assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same grid.  This will be true for output
            files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (2) BPCH2ASCII will write a separate ASCII file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (3) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may be either in uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) The format of the ASCII file is:

               Data block #1 header line
               Data block #1 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
               Data block #2 header line
               Data block #2 values (format specified by FORMAT keyword)
                ...

             The header line will contain the units and size of
             each data block.

        (5) The data is written to the ASCII file in column-major 
            order (i.e. the same way as in FORTRAN), so you can read 
            the data into FORTRAN w/ the following code:

                  READ( IUNIT, '(a)' ) HEADER
                  READ( IUNIT, '(1p,7(e13.6,1x))' )
            &       ((DATA(I,J), I=1,IMX), J=1,JMX)

            where IMX and JMX are the dimensions of the data block.       
     

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2ASCII, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.ascii'
        
             ; Read data from binary punch file 'myfile.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII file 'myfile.bpch.ascii'.

 NAME:
        BPCH2COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in a
        COARDS-compliant netCDF (network Common Data Format) file.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2COARDS, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If INFILE
             is not passed, the user will be prompted to supply a 
             file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% (or %date%)
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2COARDS will write a separate
             netCDF file for each unique YYYYMMDD value contained
             within the *.bpch file.  If OUTFILE is not specified,
             BPCH2COARDS will use the default file name 
             "coards.%DATE%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories from the bpch file
             to save to netCDF format.  If omitted, BPCH2COARDS will 
             save all diagnostic categories.  
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the name of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.  Useful
             for debugging purposes.

        /NC4 -> Write a netCDF4 file instead of netCDF3. Default is
             NetCDF3. NetCDF4 support requires IDL 8.0 or later. 

        COMPRESS -> Integer 0-9 specifies amount of compression in
             netCDF4 files. Default is 2, with very little benefit
             for higher compression.

        /PCOORD -> Use mean pressure as the vertical coordinate rather
             sigma or eta

        /ALTCOORD -> Use mean altitude as the vertical coordinate
             rather than sigma or eta

        /TROPONLY -> Write only tropospheric layers

        /ONEFILE -> Write all data to one netCDF output file.
              Default is one file per calendar day.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2COARDS assumes that each data block in the *.bpch
            file is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2COARDS assumes that the number type of each data 
            block in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2COARDS assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2COARDS will write a separate COARDS-compliant netCDF
            file corresponding to each unique YYYYMMDD date.  This 
            prevents the files from becoming too large to be read
            with IDL.

        (5) BPCH2COARDS will replace the %DATE% (or %date%) token with
            the current YYYYMMDD value.  Therefore, it is recommended
            to insert this token into the string passed via OUTFILE.

        (6) BPCH2COARDS will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the eta or sigma centers will also be written to the
            file.  Time will be written as TAU values (i.e. hours
            since 00:00 GMT on 01-Jan-1985.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2COARDS, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more COARDS-compliant netCDF files adhering
            ; to the filename convention "myfile.YYYYMMDD.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2GMI

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.  The data
        will be shifted so that the first longitude is 0 degrees
        (i.e. the prime meridian) in order to conform with the
        GMI (Global Model Initiative) model grid definition.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2GMI, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
             array of names which will restrict the data block 
             selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
             within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2G_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2G_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2G_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2GMI assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2GMI assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2GMI assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2GMI will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2GMI will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2GMI will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers will also be written to the file.  
            Date and time are stored as global attributes.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2GMI, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2HDF

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in HDF-SD 
        (Hierarchical Data Format, Scientific Dataset) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2HDF, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the HDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2HDF will write a separate
             HDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2hdf_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in HDF format to OUTFILE.

        UNDEFINE        REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        HDF_SETSD       GETMODELANDGRIDINFO

 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the HDF-SD routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2HDF assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt).  

        (2) BPCH2HDF assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will be true
            for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (3) BPCH2HDF will write a separate HDF file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  These tokens may be in either
            uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will also write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes, sigma coordinates (for 3-D data blocks only!)
            to the HDF file.

        (5) BPCH2HDF will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers and sigma edges will also be written 
            to the file.

 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2HDF, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to
            ; one or more HDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.hdf"

 NAME:
        BPCH2NC

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2NC, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2N_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2N_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2N_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================

        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2NC assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2NC assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2NC assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2NC will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2NC will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  

        (7) For pure-sigma grids (e.g. GEOS-1, GEOS-STRAT, GEOS-3),
            BPCH2NC will write the following additional variables to 
            the netCDF file:

            (1) SIGE : Sigma coordinate at level edges
            (2) SIGC : Sigma coordinate at level centers

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:

                Pe(L) = Ptop + [ SIGE(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = Ptop + [ SIGC(L) * ( Psurface - Ptop ) ]

            %%%%% NOTE: This is mostly obsolete, as most met fields
            %%%%% that are used to drive CTM's are now placed onto
            %%%%% hybrid grids.

        (8) For hybrid grids (e.g. GEOS-4, GEOS-5, MERRA), the following
            dditional variables will be written to the netCDF file:

            (1) ETAE : Eta coordinate on level edges
            (2) ETAC : Eta coordinate on level centers
            (3) Ap   : Hybrid grid "A" parameter
            (4) Bp   : Hybrid grid "B" parameter

            The pressure at the bottom edge of level L is given by:
 
                Pe(L) = Ap(L) + ( Bp(L) * Psurface )

            and the pressure at the vertical center of level L is:

                Pc(L) = ( Pe(L) + Pe(L+1) ) * 0.5

            The hybrid ETA coordinates (similar to sigma) at the 
            level edges and centers are, correspondingly:

                ETAE(L) = ( Pe(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )
                ETAC(L) = ( Pc(L) - Ptop ) / ( Psurface - Ptop )

            %%%%% NOTE: The ETAe and ETAc values are only approximate
            %%%%% and are computed with a surface pressure of 1013.25
            %%%%% hPa.  For your scientific analysis, you should compute
            %%%%% the pressures at level edges from Ap, Bp, and a 
            %%%%% spatially-varying surface pressure field (e.g. saved
            %%%%% out from GEOS-Chem or another model).
          
        (7) The date and time of the data are stored in the netCDF 
            file as global attributes.

        (8) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2NC, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        BPCH2PCH

 PURPOSE:
        Translates data from GAMAP-readable binary punch
        file v. 2.0 format to the ancient ASCII-punch
        file standard.
       
 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2PCH, FILENAME [, OUTFILENAME [, Keywords ] ]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the binary punch file from which 
             to read data.  FILENAME may be a file mask, and may
             contain wild card characters (e.g. ~/ctm.bpch.*). If
             FILENAME is omitted or contains a wild card character,
             the user will be prompted to pick a file via a dialog box.

        OUTFILENAME (optional) -> Name of the output ASCII punch
             file.  Default is 'ASCIIfile.pch' 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in ASCII punch format
              to OUTFILE.

         /EXTRA_SPACE -> If set, will put an extra space between
             the numbers in the ASCII punch file.  This might 
             be necessary when using MATLAB or S-PLUS to read
             in the ASCII punch file.

 OUTPUTS:
         Writes data to ASCII punch file format

 SUBROUTINES:
         CTM_GET_DATA 

 REQUIREMENTS:
         References routines from both GAMAP and TOOLS packages.

 NOTES:
         Some limitations:
         (1) Works only for global lon-lat diagnostics.           
         (2) The top header line might be inaccurate (but nobody
             really reads that anyway, so forget it for now...)

 EXAMPLE:
         BPCH2PCH, '~/bmy/ctm.bpch', '~/bmy/ctm.pch'
        
             ; Reads data from binary punch file '~/bmy/ctm.bpch'
             ; and writes it to ASCII punch file '~/bmy/ctm.pch'.

 PURPOSE:
        Copies data from several binary punch files into a single
        binary punch file.  Also can trim data down to nested-grid
        resolution if necessary

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH_LINK, INFILES, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILES -> A path name or file mask (with wildcards) 
             which indicates the names of the individual files
             to be linked together in a single bpch file.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the bpch file that will contain data
             from the individual bpch files specified by INFILES.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /CREATE_NESTED --> If set, then BPCH_LINK will trim data
             to the nested grid resolution as specified by the
             XRANGE and YRANGE keywords.

        XRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center longitudes which define the nested
             model grid. Default is [-180,180].

        YRANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the minimum and
             maximum box center latitudes which define the nested

 NAME:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN

 PURPOSE:
        Creates monthly means from GEOS-Chem output saved at less
        than monthly intervals.  Ideal for working with output of 
        high-resolution model output, especially if your queuing
        system time limits do not permit a 1-month simulation to be
        completed in a single run stage.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FILES -> A vector containing the pathnames of the files from
             which you would like to create monthly mean output.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the file (bpch format) that will
             contain the monthly mean output.  The default is 
             "bpch_monthly_mean_output.bpch".

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required
        ================================

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires other routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        Assumes that each of the files passed via the FILES argument
        contains an identical sequence of diagnostic data blocks.
        This will normally be the case for GEOS-Chem simulations that 
        have to be separated into several run stages for the queue
        system.

        Error checking is minimal, we will fix this later.  This
        routine in intended for use with files that are created from
        individual stages of a long GEOS-Chem simulation.  As such,
        we can usually assume that all files will have the same
        sequence of data blocks, and that all data blocks will be on
        the same grid.

 EXAMPLE:
        FILES = [ 'ctm.bpch.2011010100', 'ctm.bpch.2011011500' ]
        BPCH_MONTHLY_MEAN, FILES, OUTFILENAME = 'monthly_mean.bpch'

             ; Creates monthly-mean output from two GEOS-Chem bpch
             ; files that contain 15-day averaged data.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        BPCH_SEP

 PURPOSE:
        Separates data from one binary punch file into another binary 
        punch file by time (TAU0), tracer, or location indices.  Useful 
        for making smaller bpch files so that we don't run out of IDL 
        memory when reading/processing them.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format

 CALLING SEQUENCE:p
        BPCH_SEP, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> A path name or file mask (with wildcards) 
             which indicates the names of the individual files
             to be linked together in a single bpch file.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the bpch file that will contain data
             from the individual bpch files specified by INFILES.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories for which to 
             save out to OUTFILE  Default is to save all diagnostic
             categories to OUTFILE.

        TAU0 -> Time index (hours from 1 Jan 1985) denoting the
             data blocks to be saved from INFILE to OUTFILE.  You
             can use NYMD2TAU to compute this from a YYYYMMDD date.

        TRACER -> Tracer number(s) for which to save to OUTFILE.  
             Default is to save all tracers.

        II, JJ, LL -> Longitude, latitude, altitude index arrays used
             to cut down the data block to less than global size. Use
             IDL notation, meaning first element is 0.

        GLOBALCOORDS ->  When the data entries in the bpch file 
             contain only part of the global CTM grid (e.g. ND48,
             ND49, ND50, ND51) this indicates 
             that II, JJ, LL indices should be
             interpreted as global CTM indices, rather than relative
             to the regional subset grid. 

         EXCLUDE -> Reverses the selection criteria, so that the
         designated DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER are EXCLUDED from the
         output file. Everything else is included. In order to be
         excluded, a datablock must match all specified keywords:
         DIAGN, TAU0, and TRACER. 


 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ===============================================
        CTM_DIAGINFO    LITTLE_ENDIAN (function)
        OPEN_FILE       UNDEFINE 

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Assumes that II, JJ, LL contain consecutive indices in
            longitude, latitude, and altitude, respectively.

        (2) Also assumes that II, JJ, LL are in IDL notation
            (i.e. starting from zero).  This is so that you can
            pass the output from the WHERE command to BPCH_SEP.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1)
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', tau0=140256D

             ; Pulls out data blocks for TAU0=140256 (1/1/2001) from
             ; "ctm.bpch.big" and saves them in "ctm.bpch.small"


        (2) 
        INTYPE = CTM_TYPE( 'GEOS4', RES=4 )
        INGRID = CTM_GRID( INTYPE )
  
        INDX = WHERE( INGRID.XMID ge -60 AND INGRID.XMID le 60 )
        INDY = WHERE( INGRID.YMID ge   0 AND INGRID.YMID le 60 )
         
        BPCH_SEP, 'ctm.bpch.big', 'ctm.bpch.small', II=INDX, JJ=INDY

             ; Pulls out all data blocks for the geographical area
             ; from 60W - 60E longitude and 0-60N latitude.

 NAME:
        FILE_EXIST

 PURPOSE:
        FILE_EXIST checks to see whether a specified file
        can be found on disk, or if it does not exist.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = FILE_EXIST( FILE [,OPTIONS])

 INPUTS:
        FILE (str) --> the name of the file to be checked

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        PATH -> a path string (e.g. the IDL system variable !PATH)
            or a list (string array) of directory names to be
            searched for FILE. Under Unix, a trailing '/' is 
            attached to each entry; under Windows, a trailing 
            '\'; under MacOS, a trailing ':'.  VMS isn't supported. 

        FULL_PATH -> returns the path of FILE if found.  This is 
            not a true systemwide path but rather a combination
            of a PATH element (which may be relative) and FILE.

        DIRNAMES -> This keyword is now replaced by PATH, and 
            should not be used any more.

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> =1 if the file is found or =0 otherwise

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ================================================
        ADD_SEPARATOR (function)   MFINDFILE (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Requires routines from the TOOLS package.

 NOTES:
        (1) The PATH entries are expanded prior to use, so it is 
            possible to specify e.g. '~mgs/bla.pro'

        (2) FILE_EXIST will always return the first file it 
            finds that matches your specification. 

 EXAMPLES: 
        (1)
        IF ( FILE_EXIST( 'file_exist.pro' ) ) THEN PRINT, 'Found it!'

             ; Search for file_exist.pro 
       
        (2)
        DIRS = [ '../', '~/DATA/' ]
        OK   = FILE_EXIST( 'test.dat', path=dirs, full=path )
        IF ( OK ) THEN OPENR, U1, PATH
        ...
 
             ; Search for a file given a list of directories.
             ; If file is found, then open it for reading.
         
        
 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 26 Sep 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 28 Sep 1997: - added expand_path() in order to digest ~-pathnames

        mgs, 06 Nov 1997: - replaced DIRNAMES by PATH and added 
                            string seperation if PATH is a path
                            string with multiple entries
        mgs, 05 Feb 1998: - bug fix: use expand_path also if only 
                            filename is given

        RANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the [min,max] of
             the data array.  If not passed, RANGE will be computed
             (but only for numeric data types).  RANGE will be saved 
             to the HDF file as the "valid_range" attribute.

        _EXTRA=e -> picks up extra keywords for HDF_SD_SETINFO, such
             as FILL, UNIT, COORDSYS, etc...

 OUTPUTS:

 NAME:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 PURPOSE:
        Convert bpch files (matching a mask) to netCDF format. 
        The routine can work recursively : files in subdirectories
        are also searched for.
        
        This is a convenient generic wrapper for GAMAP routine
        Bpch2coards.pro, to work on several files and directories at
        once.
        
        When working recursively, the directory tree in the input
        directory is recreated as needed in the output directory.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        MAKE_MULTI_NC

 INPUTS:
        none

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MASK -> string, default is '*', that is all files

        INPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory of files to convert, if
             not specified, a dialog window pops up

        OUTPUT_PARENT_DIR -> top directory destination for netCDF
             files, if not specified, a dialog window pops up.

        RECURSION -> to search subdirectories. Default is 0
             (OFF). Set to 1 to turn it on.

        TOKEN -> set if you want to replace 'bpch' with 'nc' in all
             part of the full name. Default is to have extension
            ".nc" added to file name only.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        References routines from the GAMAP package.

 NOTES:
        To work recursively on the directories, I use FILE_SEARCH
        with 2 arguments. This is not possible with MFINDFILE, and
        works only with IDL 5.5 and above. 

 EXAMPLES:

        indir  = '/as/data/geos/GEOS_1x1/EDGAR_200607/'         
        outdir = '/home/phs/data/EDGAR_200607/nc/'             
        mask   = '*1x1'

             can be either a 2 element vector with [ DI, DJ ] or
             a scalar (DJxDI: 8=8x10, 4=4x5, 2=2x2.5, 1=1x1, 
             0.5=0.5x0.5).  Default for all models is 4x5.

        OUTFILENAME -> Name of the restart file that will be created.
             Default is "restart.bpch".

        TAU0 -> TAU value (hours from 0 GMT on 01 Jan 1985) that 
             that will be used to timestamp the restart file.
             The default TAU0 value 140256.00 (corresponds to 
             0 GMT on 01 Jan 2001).
 
        TRACERLIST -> A scalar value (or vector) of tracer numbers
             to write to the restart file.  Default is 1.
      
        DATAVALUE -> Specifies the data value that will be assigned
             to all grid boxes in the restart file.  Default is 0e0.

        DIAGN -> Specifies the diagnostic category name that will
             be used to index data fields in the restart file.
             Default is "IJ-AVG-$".

        UNIT -> Use this keyword to overwrite the default unit
             string (as specified in the "tracerinfo.dat" file)
             for each data block in the restart file.

        /NO_VERTICAL -> Set this switch to create a restart file
             with 2-D data blocks (e.g. lon x lat) instead of 3-D
             data blocks (e.g. lon x lat x alt).

        DIM -> Allows you to manually set the dimensions of the
             data blocks (for nested grids).  DIM is passed to
             CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO.

        FIRST -> Allows you to manually set the starting indices
             (in Fortran notation, starting from 1) of the data 
             block.  FIRST is passed to CTM_MAKE_DATAINFO.

 NAME:
        MFINDFILE

 PURPOSE:
        Find all the files that match a given specification.
        MFINDFILE is a wrapper for IDL routines FILE_SEARCH 
        (v5.5 and higher) and FINDFILE (v5.4 and lower).

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        LISTING = MFINDFILE( MASK )

 INPUTS:
        FILEMASK -> a path and filename specification to look for.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        none

 OUTPUTS:
        A string list containing all the files that match the 
        specification.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Routines Required:
        ===========================
        ADD_SEPARATOR (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) For IDL 5.5+, use FILE_SEARCH to return a listing of
            files with the given path name specified by MASK.  This
            should work regardless of platform.

        (2) For IDL 5.4- running under Unix, The built-in FINDFILE() 
            function has problems on whenever a lot of files are 
            matching the file specification.  This is due to the fact 
            that filename expansion is done by the shell before 
            interpreting a command.  Too many files cause too long 
            commands which are not accepted.  This causes FINDFILE() 
            to return an empty list of candidates. (cf. www.dfanning.com)
            
            Therefore, we implement a workaround where we issue a
            "ls -1" command under the Unix shell.  This isn't 100%
            foolproof either but it's better than nothing.

        (3) For IDL 5.5- running under other operating systems,
            call the built-in IDL FINDFILE routine as usual.

 EXAMPLE:
        LIST = MFINDFILE( '~mgs/terra/chem1d/code/*.f' )

        ; returns all fortran files in Martin's chem1d directory.

 NAME:
        NCDF_GET

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to read data into netCDF format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        DATA = NCDF_GET( FID, NAME [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        FID -> netCDF File ID, as returned by routine NCDF_OPEN.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved 
             to the netCDF file.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        VARINFO -> Returns a structure containing information
             about the variable read in from disk.  The structure
             has the following form:

             { NAME      : "", $
               DATATYPE  : "", $
               NDIMS     : 0L, $
               NATTS     : 0L, $
               DIM       : LONARR(NDIMS) }


        LONGNAME -> Returns the value saved under the "long_name" 
             attribute in the netCDF file.

        UNIT -> Returns the value of the "unit" attribute 
             saved in the netCDF file.

        RANGE -> Returns the value of the "valid_range" 
             saved in the netCDF file

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords got NCDF_VarGet.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> Array containing extracted data from the netCDF file.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses the following IDL netCDF routines:
        ========================================
        NCDF_VarId   (function)  NCDF_VarGet
        NCDF_VarInfo (function)  NCDF_AttGet
        NCDF_AttName (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ netCDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) Only looks for the "long_name", "unit", and "valid_range"
            attributes.  The user can extend this as he/she desires.
            For a more general program, see ~/IDL/tools/ncdf_read.pro
            by Martin Schultz.

 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define array to write to file
        ARRAY = DIST( 100, 50 )

        ; Find out if netCDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( NCDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'netCDF not supported!'

        ; Open netCDF file and get the file ID # (FID)
        FID   = NCDF_OPEN( 'myfile.nc' )
        IF ( FID lt 0 ) then Message, 'Error opening file!'

        ; Read data from the netCDF file
        ; Return data attributes in the VARINFO array
        ; Also returns the text from the UNIT string
        DATA = NCDF_GET( FID, 'BIOBSRCE::NOx', $

 NAME:
        NCDF_READ

 PURPOSE:
        Open a netCDF file and read data from it. The data is 
        returned as a structure whose tag names are the names of 
        the variables with blanks etc. replaced. If no variables 
        are specified with the VARIABLES keyword, only dimensional 
        information is returned. You can load all variables using
        the ALL keyword. Other keyword options include OFFSET, COUNT, STRIDE,
        NO_DIMENSIONS, NO_STRUCT, DIMNAMES, VARNAMES, VARDIMS, ATTRIBUTES.
        Thus, this program includes ncdump functionality.
        If no filename is given, a file selection dialog is
        opened with the default mask '*.nc'. The name of the selected
        file is returned in the TRUENAME keyword. A file selection
        dialog also appears when the file cannot be found (see
        OPEN_FILE.PRO). This can be turned off with the NO_DIALOG
        keyword. The VERBOSE keyword provides information while
        analyzing and reading the file.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_READ, result, filename=<string>, truename=<string>,
            variables=<stringarray>, all=<flag>, varnames=<stringarray>, 
            vardimid=<structure>, vardims=<structure>, attributes=<structure>,
            count=<integerarray>, offset=<integerarray>, stride=<integerarray>, 
            dimnames=<stringarray>, dims=<longarray>, no_dimensions=<flag>,
            no_struct=<flag>, no_dialog=<flag>, verbose=<flag>, title=<string>

 ARGUMENTS:
        RESULT(out) -> a structure containing all the variable data
             from the netCDF file. If only one variable is specified 
             and the NO_STRUCT keyword set, then RESULT will be an
             array instead of a structure. Use the ALL keyword
             to load all variables at once. Note, that the COUNT, OFFSET,
             and STRIDE keywords can affect the size of RESULT.
             RESULT is set to -1L if an error occurs before the structure
             has been built. You can use CHKSTRU.PRO to test for this.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME(in) -> the name of the netCDF file to be opened.
             NCDF_READ uses OPEN_FILE to check the validity of
             the file first. You can specify a search mask
             instead of a filename in which case a file selection
             dialog is displayed (unless you set the NO_DIALOG
             keyword). The TRUENAME keyword contains the name
             of the selected file or an empty string if the
             file selection was canceled.

        TRUENAME(out) -> the (fully qualified) name of the file selected
             with the file selection dialog or an unaltered copy
             of FILENAME if FILENAME is a valid filename.

        VARIABLES(in) -> a string array containing the names of variables
             for which data shall be read. Default is to read 
             only the dimensional information from the file. 
             (Currently) no warning is issued if a variable is not in the file.

        ALL(in) -> set this keyword to load all variables stored in the 
             netCDF file. Generally, you cannot usethis keyword together with
             COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE.

        VARNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of all variables 
             as stored in the file. Note, that the tag names of e.g. the
             result structure are filtered with the Valid_TagName function.
             
        VARDIMID(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimension ID's for all variables. See also VARDIMS which returns
             the dimensions themselves.

        VARDIMS(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimensions for all variables in the netCDF file. These are not
             kept in sync with potential COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE values,
             but reflect the data sizes as stored in the file.

        ATTRIBUTES(out) -> a structure holding the variable and global
             attributes stored in the netCDF file (global attributes
             are stored in tag name GLOBAL). 

        COUNT(in) -> an integer array containing the number of values to
             be read for each dimension of the variables. Mapping of the
             COUNT dimensions to the variable dimensions is achieved via
             the first entry in the VARIABLES list and the COUNT parameter
             will be applied to all variables that have that dimension. 
             Example: The first variable has dimensions LON, LAT, LEV,
             the second variable has dimensions LON, LAT, and the third
             variable has LAT, LEV. A COUNT of [40,20,10] would lead to
             result dimensions of [40,20,10], [40,20], and [20,10].

        OFFSET(in) -> an integer array containing the offsets for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.

        STRIDE(in) -> an integer array containing the stride for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.
             
        DIMNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of the 
             dimensions stored in the netCDF file.

        DIMS(out) -> a long array containing the dimension values. Purely
             for convenience. Use VARDIMS to retrieve the dimensions of
             the variables.

        TITLE(in) -> A title for the file selection dialog if an
             incomplete or incorrect filename is specified. This
             keyword is ignored if the no_dialog keyword is set.

        NO_DIMENSIONS(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want to store
             the dimensional variables from the file in the result structure. 
             DIMNAMES and DIMS will still be retrieved.

        NO_STRUCT(in) -> if only one variable is selected with the
             VARIABLE keyword, you can set this keyword to return only
             the data for this variable as an array. This keyword implies
             the functionality of NO_DIMENSIONS.

        NO_DIALOG(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want interactive 
             behaviour when a file mask is given instead of a filename or
             when the specified file does not exist.

        VERBOSE(in) -> set this keyword to get detailed information while
             reading the netCDF file.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Valid_TagName : replaces invalid characters in variable names so that
            a structure can be built.
      
        ncdf_attributes : retrieves global and variable attributes from netcdf
            file and stores them as structure.

        ncdf_dimensions : retrieves size and name for all dimensions in netcdf file.

        ncdf_varnames : retrieves names and dimension information for all variables
            in the netCDF file.

        ncdf_mapdims : map dimension indices for COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE with 
            dimensions of first selected variable.

        ncdf_TestDimensions : compute the COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE vectors that
            must be applied for retrieving the data of one variable.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses OPEN_FILE and STRREPL.

 NOTES:
        Correct handling of dimensional information requires that the variables
        storing the dimension values have the same name as the dimensions
        themselves - a common feature in most netCDF standards.

        I am still working on a netcdf file object which will be even
        more powerful. At some point ncdf_read will only be a
        procedure interface to this objec!

 NAME:
        NCDF_SET

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to write data into netCDF format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_SET, FID, DATA, NAME, DIMS [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FID -> netCDF File ID, as returned by routine NCDF_CREATE.

        DATA -> Data (array or scalar) to be written to netCDF file.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved 
             to the netCDF file.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LONGNAME -> Longer descriptive name for the data.  
             This will be saved as the "long_name" attribute.  

        RANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the [min,max] of
             the data array.  If not passed, RANGE will be computed
             (but only if DATA is a numeric type).  RANGE is saved 
             to the netCDF file as the "valid_range" attribute.

        UNIT -> String containing the units of the data. 
             This will be saved as the "unit" attribute.       

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses the following routines:
        =====================================================
        NCDF_Control    NCDF_VarDef     (function)
        NCDF_AttPut     DATATYPE        (function from TOOLS)
        NCDF_VarPut     NCDF_VALID_NAME (function from TOOLS)   

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ netCDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) For now, treat BYTE data like CHAR data.  This is
            most likely since netCDF does not support STRING types,
            strings have to be stored as arrays of bytes.

 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define array to write to file
        ARRAY = DIST( 100, 50 )

        ; Find out if netCDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( NCDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'netCDF not supported!'

        ; Open netCDF file and get the file ID # (FID)
        FID = NCDF_CREATE( 'myfile.nc', /CLOBBER )
        IF ( FID lt 0 ) then Message, 'Error opening file!'

        ; Set dimensions for netCDF file
        S    = SIZE( ARRAY, /DIM ) 
        DIM1 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Length', S[0] )
        DIM2 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Width',  S[1] )

        ; Go into netCDF DATA mode
        NCDF_CONTROL, FID, /ENDEF

        ; Call NCDF_SET to write the array to the file
        NCDF_SET, FID, ARRAY, 'My Data', [ DIM1, DIM2 ], $
                  LONGNAME='Data array created by me!',  $
                  UNIT='unitless'

        ; Close the netCDF file
        NCDF_CLOSE, FID

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

        bmy, 10 Sep 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.51
                          - Now call routine DATATYPE to determine
                            the type of the data so that we can
                            write to the netCDF file appropriately
                          - Don't add the RANGE attribute to
                            the netCDF file for a string type value.
                          - Updated comments 
        bmy, 21 Oct 2003: TOOLS VERSION 1.53
                          - now "sanitize" the netCDF variable name
                            w/ routine NCDF_VALID_NAME.  The new netCDF
                            library in IDL 6.0+ chokes on bad characters.

 NAME:
        NCDF_VALID_NAME

 PURPOSE:
        Strips invalid characters from a string which is to be
        used as a netCDF variable name.  Based on original code
        by Martin Schultz.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( ARG )

 INPUTS:
        ARG -> netCDF variable name string to be examined.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> New netCDF name string with "bad" characters
             replaced by "good" characters.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Used:
        ==========================
        STRREPL (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        In IDL 6.0+, the netCDF library has been updated.  Some
        characters which used to be allowed in netCDF variable names
        are no longer allowed.  Therefore, use this function to
        replace "bad" characters with "good" characters when 
        reading or writing to/from netCDF files.

 EXAMPLE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( 'IJ-AVG-$::CO' )
        PRINT, RESULT

             ; Prints "IJ-AVG-S__CO"

 NAME:
        OPEN_FILE

 PURPOSE:
        Open a file for input. This routine can automatically
        decide whether to use DIALOG_PICKFILE, and it contains
        basic error handling. After successful operation the
        file with logical unit LUN will be open for input.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        OPEN_FILE,filemask,lun [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILEMASK -> a filename with path information that may
            contain wildcards ('*', '?')

        LUN -> a named variable that will contain the logical unit
            number upon return. If a unit number > 0 is passed,
            an attempt is made to open the file with this number,
            otherwise, a free unit is selected with /GET_LUN. In case
            of an error, LUN contains -1. This can be used instead of
            the RESULT keyword to detect errors (see below).

        (both parameters are mandatory !)

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> a named variable that will contain the complete
            filename upon return (i.e. the file selected with PICKFILE)

        WRITE -> Set this keyword to open a file for read and write
            operations. Normally, a file is opened for reading only.

        RESULT -> a named variable that will return the error status
            of the operation. A value of 0 indicates the file was
            opened sucessfully, otherwise the value of !Error_State.Code
            is returned.

        PICKFILE -> logical flag to force use of the DIALOG_PICKFILE
            routine, even if a complete filemask without wildcards was
            passed.

        TITLE -> the title of the pickfile dialog. Default is
            'Choose a file'.

        DEFAULTMASK -> A default filemask to be used when no filename
            is given or the filename does not contain wildcards and
            /PICKFILE is set. This mask will also be used if the
            file cannot be opened because of 'FILE NOT FOUND' error.

        NO_PICKFILE -> prevents the pickfile dialog for batch operation.
            The filemask must not contain wildcards.
            Normally a 'FILE NOT FOUND' condition leads to
            a second attempt with the /PICKFILE flag set (recursive
            call). Use this flag if you want to abort instead.

        _EXTRA keywords are passed to the openr routine
            (e.g. /F77_UNFORMATTED)

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 13 Aug 1998: VERSION 1.00
                          - extracted from ctm_read3dp_header.pro and 
                            modified
        mgs, 14 Aug 1998: - small bug fix: handle empty filename
                            string correctly
        mgs, 22 Aug 1998: - added WRITE keyword to open writable files
        mgs, 22 Oct 1998: - now always returns LUN=-1 in case of an error
        mgs, 21 Jan 1999: - Added explicit F77_Unformatted keyword and set
                            Swap_If_Little_Endian or Swap_If_Big_Endian  
                            automatically
        mgs, 10 Feb 1999: - bug fix: swap_if was wrong way round
        mgs, 12 May 1999: - ok. finally got the hang of byte swapping! 
                            It's the machine architecture not the operating
                            system!  Now changed it so that !VERSION.ARCH is
                            tested for 'x86'
        mgs, 20 May 1999: - abandoned SWAP_IF completely and use explicit
                            SWAP_ENDIAN keyword in users grace now.
        bmy, 14 Oct 2003: TOOLS VERSION 1.53
                          - For IDL 6.0+, if PATH is a null string, then
                            manually reset it to './'.  This will avoid
                            the contents of the !PATH variable from being
                            listed in the dialog box. 
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
  cdh & phs, 30 Jun 2008: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - declare dummy GET_LUN keyword. It
                            prevents passing GET_LUN w/ _extra to
                            openr/w, since LUN is already assigned in
                            all cases.

 NAME:

 PURPOSE:
        Given a file, returns the directory in which the file resides.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = PROGRAM_DIR( FILE [, Keywords ] )

 INPUTS:
        FILE -> Name of the file for which a directory search
             will be performed.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /FULL_PATH -> Set this switch to return the directory
             name as an absolute path (e.g. /users/home/IDL/) 
             instead of a relative path (e.g. ~/IDL).

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ==============================
        EXPAND_PATH      (function) 
        EXTRACT_FILENAME (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        (1) Unix is case-sensitive.  It is recommended to keep 
            file names in all lowercase on Unix to avoid file 
            search confusion.

 EXAMPLES:
        (1) 
        PRINT, PROGRAM_DIR( 'myct.pro' )
           ~/IDL/tools/

            ; Finds the directory in which "myct.pro" resides.

        PRINT, PROGRAM_DIR( 'myct.pro', /FULL_PATH )
           /users/ctm/bmy/IDL/tools

            ; Same as the above example, but this time returns
            ; the directory as an absolute path name.

 NAME:
        READDATA

 PURPOSE:
        This subroutine reads in  almost any ASCII file and returns 
        two arrays containing the names of the variables and their 
        values.  The data is read line by line or in one step if 
        LINES is specified.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       READDATA, FILENAME, DATA, HEADER [, NCOL, NDAT ] [, KEYWORDS ]

 INPUTS:
       FNAME -> Name of fname to be read, e.g. 'flight12.dat'

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       COLS -> number of columns to be read (must be used if no header 
             is read in, i.e. /NOHEADER is specified). Can be used
             to read in a subset of columns if the file contains a header
             line with variable names (i.e. if *not* /NOHEADER).

       LINES -> number of lines to be read (not much faster for large
             data sets, but allows to read in a subset of the data)

       DELIM -> Separator between names in the header (default=',')

       SKP1 -> Number of lines to be skipped before the variable 
             definition (default=0)

       SKP2 -> .. after the variable definition (default=0)

       SKIP -> same as SKP1 (SKP1 will overwrite SKIP. SKIP may be
             not longer supported in future versions !)

       AUTOSKIP  -> for files that state the number of comment lines 
             in the first line. If keyword NOHEADER is not set, READDATA 
             expects a list of variable names as last comment line.
             AUTOSKIP overrides settings of SKP1 and SKP2.

       TRANSPOSE -> Normally, 1st array dimension is for variables, 
             2nd is for observations. /TRANSPOSE will reverse that 
             order (see note).

       NOHEADER -> don't read a header (COLS must be specified in 
             this case !)

       NODATA -> don't read data (stop after header). DATA parameter 
             must still be specified !

       COMMENTS -> returns string array of all the comment lines in 
             the data file for later use

       MAXCOMMENTS -> limits maximum number of comment lines to be 
             retrieved (default: 255)

       QUIET -> Normally, READDATA prints the number of variables 
             found and  number of data lines read.  Use this option 
             to suppress all output.

       /DOUBLE -> If set, will return data in double precision.
             (Default is to return data in single precision.)

       NAN_REPLACEMENT -> Allows you to provide a replacement value
             for the following types of missing data fields: NaN,
             nan, NA, na, Infinity, infinity, Missing, missing.

 OUTPUTS:
       DATA -> data array that was read in

       NAMES -> string array of names in header

       NCOL -> integer containing the number of columns

       NDAT -> long integer containing the number of observations

       COMMENTS  -> string array containing all header lines.  
             If AUTOSKIP is set, skp1, and skp2 will contain the 
             actual amount of lines to skip (e.g. for re-storing 
             header information in EXPLORE)

 SUBROUTINES:
      External Subroutines Required:
      ==============================
      OPEN_FILE
      STRBREAK (function)
      USAGE

 REQUIREMENTS:
      None

 NOTES:
      Default of the returned DATA array is: 1st index = variable, 
      2nd index = observation. Use the /TRANSPOSE option for reverse order

      If /NOHEADER is used, then COLS must specify the actual number of
      data columns in FNAME. Otherwise it can be used to read a subset of 
      the data from 0 to cols-1 columns.

      IDL Parameters are optional. Of course, you should not readdata without
      passing a DATA argument, but you can ignore the HEADER,NCOL, and NDAT 
      params.

 EXAMPLES:
      (1)
      READDATA,'mydata.dat',DATA,HEADER,DELIM=' ',SKIP=5

      ... will read in the ASCII file mydata.dat and store the data in DATA.
      The header information will be stored in HEADER. The header items are
      seperated by blank spaces, and the first 5 lines should be ignored.
      To pick a certain variable afterwards, type:
      VAR = DATA(WHERE HEADER EQ 'MYVAR'),*)

      (2)
      READDATA,'noheader.dat',DATA,DELIM=';',NCOLS=3

      ... will read a three column ASCII file with no header information.
      You can manually make up a header with 
      HEADER = ['VAR1','VAR2','VAR3'] 
      or you can pass the HEADER argument and receive ['X1','X2','X3'] as
      header.

      (3)
      READDATA,'mydata.dat',DATA,HEADER,DELIM=' ',SKP1=5,LINES=60,COLS=4, $
         COMMENTS=COMMENTS

      ... will read in 60 lines and 4 columns of the ASCII file mydata.dat 
      and return 6 comment lines in COMMENTS (5 + variable names)


 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
         mgs  03/12/1997: - last update : 05/22/97
         mgs 01 Aug 1997: - added template
         mgs 15 Sep 1997: - added LINES option and removed some twitch in the
                            handling of TRANSPOSE. Unfortunately,
                            LINES does not improve the speed as
                            desired, but you can restrict the reading to
                            a smaller subset of the data.
         mgs 26 Sep 1997: MAJOR REVIEW
                          - bug fixes in noheader option
                          - bug fixes in COLS and NCOL handling
                          - removed units option and created comments 
                            keyword instead.  program now reads in
                            all header lines into a string array
                            including the variable names line.
                          - automatic generation of a header if 
                            /NOHEADER is specified
         mgs 06 Nov 1997: - Added AUTOSKIP option for easier reading 
                            of e.g. NASA formatted files.
         mgs 01 Dec 1997: added MAXCOMMENTS keyword and limit
                          - skp1 now returns correct amount if

 NAME:
        READ_BDT0001

 PURPOSE:
        Read a simple binary data file with size information
        and variable names and units (format BDT0001).

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_BDT0001,filename,data,vardesc,nvars,nlines [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file to read or a file mask that
            will be used in the PICKFILE dialog (see OPEN_FILE)
            If FILENAME is a named variable, the actual filename
            will be returned and replace a template.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NAMES -> a named variable will contain a string array with
            NVARS variable names

        UNITS -> ... a string array with NVARS physical units

        COMMENTS -> A named variable that will return comment lines
            stored in the data file. NOTE that comments are not
            saved in vardesc.

        DEFAULTMASK -> Default mask for PICKFILE dialog (see
            OPEN_FILE).

        FILE_ID -> A named variable will return the file identifier
            string (80 characters). This string will be returned
            even if the file is of wrong type and no data was read.

        TYPE -> A named variable will contain the data type

        _EXTRA keywords are passed on to OPEN_FILE

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> an array with NLINES * NVARS values. The type of the
            data array depends on the information stored in the file.

        VARDESC -> A variable descriptor structure (see GTE_VARDESC)

        NVARS -> number of variables in file

        NLINES -> number of data lines


 SUBROUTINES:

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Uses OPEN_FILE

 NOTES:
        See also WRITE_BDT0001

        Format specification:
        file_ID  :      80 byte character string
        NVARS, NLINES, NCOMMENTS, TYPE : 4 byte integer (long)
        NAMES :         NVARS*40 byte character string
        UNITS :         NVARS*40 byte character string
        COMMENTS :      NCOMMENTS records of 80 byte length
        DATA  :         8 byte float (double) array NLINES*NVARS

 EXAMPLE:
        READ_BDT0001,'~/tmp/*.bdt',data,vardesc,comments=comments

        ; Will read a file that the user selects with the PICKFILE
        ; dialog. No information about the actual filename is
        ; returned.

        FILE = '~/tmp/*.bdt'
        READ_BDT0001,FILE,data,vardesc,nvars,nlines,file_id=file_id

        ; Does the same thing, but this time FILE will contain the
        ; actual filename. The number of variables and lines are
        ; returned in NVARS and NLINES, the file identifier string
        ; is returned in file_id

 NAME:
        READ_BIN  and  PLOT_BIN

 PURPOSE:
        Read a simple binary 2-D file. The file must be F77 
        unformatted and contain the XDIM and YDIM information
        as LONG integers in the first record.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_BIN,FILENAME,DATA [,keywords]
        PLOT_BIN,DATA [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file to read

        DATA (for PLOT_BIN) -> The data array as read with READ_BIN 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        XDIM, YDIM -> return the dimensions of the data set.

        _EXTRA -> used to pass extra keywords to OPEN_FILE. Probably
              only useful with /SWAP_ENDIAN.

        /PLOT -> Call PLOT_BIN directly.

        (for PLOT_BIN)
        MIN, MAX -> minimum and maximum to be used for conversion of
              data to a byte array for display with TVIMAGE

        TOP -> top value for BYTSCL

        CT -> colortable numebr to use

        /MAP -> set this keyword to overlay a map (isotropic cylindrical
              projection)

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> The data array returned from READ_BIN

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses OPEN_FILE and TVIMAGE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        Rather primitive program but demonstrates the principle use
        of binary data files and TVIMAGE.

 EXAMPLES:
        READ_BIN,'~/mydata/*.bdat', DATA
        PLOT_BIN, DATA, MIN=MIN(DATA,MAX=M), MAX=M

        ; is equivalent to 
        READ_BIN, '~/mydata/*.bdat', DATA, /PLOT

 NAME:
        READ_SONDE

 PURPOSE:
        Read climatological ozone sonde data as compiled by 
        Jennifer A. Logan at Harvard University.
        If successful, the procedure returns a structure 
        with all information from a sondeXXX.* file.
        Ozone concentrations are automatically converted to ppbv.
        The data can be downloaded via ftp from io.harvard.edu
        path= pub/exchange/sonde. Please read the README files!

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences, File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_SONDE,filename,data

 INPUTS:
        filename -> Name of the file containing the sonde data.
            This parameter can contain wildcards (*,?) in which case
            a file selection dialog will be displayed. If filename
            is a variable, it will be replaced by the actual filename
            that was opened.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        MBAR -> return ozone concentrations in mbar rather than ppbv

        STATIONS -> Can be used either as input or output for a list
            of station codes, locations and names as retrieved with
            procedure read_sondestations. STATIONS must be specified
            (or is returned) as an array of structures.

 OUTPUTS:
        DATA -> A structure containing the following fields:
                TITLE           STRING    'Ozone sonde data'
                STATION         STRING    <station name>

                                                       month and altitude >
        If the station.codes file was read successfully, three more tags
        are added to the structure:
                LAT, LON, ALT   FLOAT  < geographical location of station >

 SUBROUTINES:
        parse_line

 REQUIREMENTS:
        This subroutine uses the following procedures and functions that
        are not contained in the standard IDL distribution:
        READ_SONDESTATIONS : tool for reading the station.codes file
              (if you de-activate the line calling this procedure, READ_SONDE
               will still work but not return the station coordinates)

        EXTRACT_FILENAME  : a utility to seperate file path and file name 

        FILE_EXIST : a function testing for existance of a file

        OPEN_FILE  : more flexible than openr
              (if you choose not to use OPEN_FILE, you can replace the
               line that contains OPEN_FILE with:
                   OPENR,filename,ilun,/get_lun 
               You then don't need any of the following programs)

        UNDEFINE   : David Fanning's routine for dynamic removal of variables

 NOTES:

 EXAMPLE:
        ; read sonde data file
        read_sonde,filename,data

        ; test if successful
        if (n_elements(data) eq 0) then stop

        ; plot tropospheric profiles for all 12 month
        plot,data.concentration[*,0],data.pressure,  $

             color=fix(i/6.)+1,line=(i mod 6)
        ; add station location as label
        label = '  LAT:'+string(data.lat,format='(f5.1)')+  $

 NAME:
        READ_SONDESTATIONS

 PURPOSE:
        Retrieve station codes and geographical locations for 
        ozone sonding stations as listed in file station.codes
        from Jennifer A. Logan's ozone sonde climatology.
        This routine is called from procedure READ_SONDE, and
        only needs to be called explicitely if the station.codes
        file resides neither in the current directory nor the 
        directory of the sonde data files.
        The procedure will read the file station.codes once then
        store the information in a common block for later use.

 CATEGORY:
        Atmospheric Sciences, File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        READ_SONDESTATIONS,stations [,filename]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME (optional) -> if given, it specifies the path and filename
              of the file that is normally called station.codes.
              FILENAME may contain wildcards (*,?) in which case a 
              file selector dialog is displayed. 

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        STATIONS -> An array with structures containing the stations
              codes (integer), latitude, longitude, altitude (float),
              amd name (string). 

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses OPEN_FILE and EXTRACT_FILENAME (used in OPEN_FILE)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        read_sondestations,stations,'station.codes'
        ; if called for the first time, reads file station.codes
        ; and returns information for all stations in stations.
        ; NOTE: In this case, the filename argument could have been
        ; omitted.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> returns the file in which the routine can be found

        /CALLER -> returns information about the caller of the routine
           instead of the routine itself

 OUTPUTS:
        The name of the caller routine is returned in lowercase
        characters (can be used to construct a filename by adding
        ".pro")

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        From the command line:
             PRINT, ROUTINE_NAME()
        results in   $main$

        Very useful in conjunction with USAGE.PRO:
             USAGE, ROUTINE_NAME()
        displays help information on the current routine.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 27 Mar 1998: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 22 Apr 1998: - added FILENAME and CALLER keywords
        mgs, 14 Jan 1998: - needed fix for filename when working on PC:

        bmy, 07 Aug 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.51
                          - Now use routine STRBREAK to split the line
                            instead of STR_SEP.  STR_SEP has been removed
                            from the IDL distribution in IDL 5.4+.

 NAME:
        TESTPATH

 PURPOSE:
        Set !PATH variable to a limited set of directories for test
        purposes (or restore the initial value)

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        TESTPATH [,pathstring] [,/restore]

 INPUTS:
        PATHSTRING -> a string with the test directory name(s)
             The !PATH variable will contain this string plus the
             standard IDL library search path [which is hardwired
             and may have to be changed after future updates].
             Note: This parameter is ignored if the /RESTORE keyword 
             is set.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        /RESTORE -> restore initial value of !PATH. This is always
             the value before the very first call to testpath! Use
             of this keyword overrides the PATHSTRING parameter.

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        testpath,'~mgs/IDL/test3d'
        ; sets !PATH to the given name + standard IDL libraries

        testpath,/restore
        ; resets !PATH variable to original value

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:

 NAME:
        WRITEDATA

 PURPOSE:
        write a 2 dimensional data array and header information to a file

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        WRITEDATA,FILENAME,DATA [,HEADER,UNITS,CFACT,MCODE] [,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME --> the name of the output file. If the output file
            exists, the user will be prompted for a new name unless
            keyword NO_WARN is set.

        DATA --> The data array to be written.

        HEADER --> An optional string array containing variable names.
            These will be composed to a string using the DELIM delimiter.
            Note that the HEADER information can also be passed in the
            pre-formatted COMMENTS keyword parameter.

        UNITS, CFACT, MCODE --> string arrays that will be added to the
            file header concatenated with blank delimiters. These parameters
            are optional and merely there to facilitate creating chem1d
            model input files.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        TITLE --> A title string that will be the first header line.
            It is also possible to pass a string array here, although for
            more complicate file headers it is recommended to pre-format
            the file header and pass it in the COMMENTS keyword.

        DELIM --> A delimiter character for the HEADER (variable name)
            items. Default is a blank ' '.

        COMMENTS --> A string array containing all the lines of the file
            header. Note that COMMENTS overrules the input of HEADER, UNITS,
            CFACT, and MCODE as well as TITLE.

        /NO_WARN --> Suppress warning message and user prompt for a new
            filename if the file already exists.

 OUTPUTS:
        A file containing a file header and the data array written
        line by line.

 SUBROUTINES:
        None

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        None

 EXAMPLE:
        DATA = findgen(3,10)
        HEADER = ['A','B','C']
        writedata,'test.out',DATA,HEADER,TITLE='test file',DELIM=';'

        This will create a file like:
            test file
            A;B;C
                  0.00000      1.00000      2.00000
                  3.00000      4.00000      5.00000
            ...

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        mgs, 25 Nov 1997: VERSION 1.00
        mgs, 05 Apr 1999: - now uses formatted write statement
                 (looks like a bug in IDL for windows: sometimes no space
                  is printed between numbers if you simply print,data)

 NAME:
        WRITE_BDT0001

 PURPOSE:
        Write a binary data file with size information and
        variable names and units

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        WRITE_BDT0001,filename,data,vardesc[,keywords]

 INPUTS:
        FILENAME -> Name of the file to write or a file mask
            which will be used in the PICKFILE dialog. If the 
            filemask is a named variable, it will return the 
            actual filename.

        DATA -> a 2D data array with dimensions LINES,VARIABLES

        VARDESC -> A variable descriptor structure array (see 
            GTE_VARDESC). This array must contain one structure 
            for each variable and the structure must have the 
            tags NAME and UNIT. Alternatively, you can use the
            NAMES and UNITS keywords to pass string arrays.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        NAMES -> A string array containing variable names. This 
            will only be used if no VARDESC structure array is 
            given.
 
        UNITS -> A string array with physical units for each 
            variable. (see NAMES)

        COMMENTS -> A string (or string array) with comment lines.
            Only the first 80 characters of each line will be stored.

        SELECTION -> An index array to select only a subset of
            variables from the data set. Indices are truncated 
            to lie in the range 0..n_elements(names), which can
            lead to multiple output of the same variable!

        _EXTRA keywords are passed on to OPEN_FILE

        Flags to determine the data type:
        Default is to store the data in its current type. Use the
        TYPE keyword to convert it to any other (numeric) type
        or use one of the following keywords. The type information
        is saved in the file, so READ_BDT0001 can automatically 
        read the data regardless of the format.

        /BYTE -> convert data to byte format
        /INT -> convert data to (2 byte) integer format
        /LONG -> convert data to (4 byte) integer format
        /FLOAT -> convert data to (4 byte) real format
        /DOUBLE -> convert data to (8 byte) double prec. real format
        /COMPLEX -> convert data to (8 byte) complex
        /DCOMPLEX -> convert data to (16 byte) double complex

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses OPEN_FILE, STR2BYTE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        Format specification:
        file_ID  :      80 byte character string
        NVARS, NLINES, NCOMMENTS, TYPE : 4 byte integer (long)
        NAMES :         NVARS*40 byte character string
        UNITS :         NVARS*40 byte character string
        COMMENTS :      NCOMMENTS records with 80 characters each
        DATA  :         8 byte float (double) array NLINES*NVARS

 EXAMPLE:
        WRITE_BDT0001,'~/tmp/*.bdt',data,vardesc
